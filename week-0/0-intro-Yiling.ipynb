      "A version of the story, Ye Xian, appeared in Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi around 860.[12] In this version, Ye Xian is the daughter of the local tribal leader who died when she was young. Because her mother died before her father, she is now under the care of her father's second wife, who abused her. She befriends a fish, which is the reincarnation of her deceased mother.[12] Her stepmother and half-sister kill the fish, but Ye Xian found the bones, which are magical, and they help her dress appropriately for a local Festival, including a very light golden shoe.[12] Her stepfamily recognizes her at the festival, causing her to flee and accidentally lose the shoe.  Afterwards, the king of another sea island obtained the shoe and is curious about the shoe as no one has feet that can fit the shoe. The King searched everywhere and finally came upon Ye's house. She tries on the shoe, and the king then realises she is the one and takes her back to his kingdom. Her cruel stepmother and half-sister are then killed by flying fish.[13] Variants of the story are also found in many ethnic groups in China.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "The existing version of the Japanese tale dates back only the 13th century, but mention of it occurs in the early 11th-century Genji Monogatari (Tale of Genji). Sumiyoshi refers to a village and a shrine in the Osaka area. There in the shrine the Cinderella figure has taken refuge, when her lover, following a dream, is reunited with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several different variants of the story appear in the medieval One Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, including \"The Second Shaykh's Story\", \"The Eldest Lady's Tale\" and \"Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers\", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others, they are male. One of the tales, \"Judar and His Brethren\", departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Story of Tam and Cam, from Vietnam, is similar to the Chinese version. The heroine Tấm also had a fish which was killed by the stepmother and the half-sister, and its bones also give her clothes.[15] Later after marrying the king, Tấm was killed by her stepmother and sister, and reincarnated several times in form of a bird, a loom and a \"gold apple\". She finally reunited with the king and lived happily ever after.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moon Brow [fa] (Persian: ماه پیشونی, mâh pishâni) is the Iranian version of the story. This version is about Shahrbanou, daughter of a rich merchant and her evil stepmother and stepsister. At the end of the story, Shahrbanou marries a prince; who falls in love with Shahrbanou after seeing her in a wedding. Iranian academic Morteza Heidari believes the Moon Brow is the oldest variant of Cinderella's story.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "The first written European version of the story was published in Napoli (Naples), Italy, by Giambattista Basile, in his Pentamerone (1634). The story itself was set in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1697),[5] and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales (1812).\n",
      "\n",
      "The name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" (ash, cinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually soiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because they had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by sitting close to the fireplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giambattista Basile, an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled Lo cunto de li cunti (The Story of Stories), or Pentamerone. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers.[18]\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at: That \"without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense. These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\"[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "Another well-known version was recorded by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century. The tale is called \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Cinderella\" in English translations). This version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father did not die and the stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that the heroine planted on her mother's grave.  In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Grimms supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment for their cruelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "\n",
      "Aschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; Perrault's version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter. However, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child. He also describes Aschenputtel as his \"first wife's child\" and not his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular 1950 Disney film, Cinderella's father has died and so has Cinderella's mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor: in Fair, Brown and Trembling and Finette Cendron, the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are Cap O' Rushes, Catskin, All-Kinds-of-Fur, and Allerleirauh, and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.[22] In Katie Woodencloak, the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "In La Cenerentola, Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her stepfather. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The fairy godmother is Perrault's own addition to the tale.[24] The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms's version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as The Cinder Maid, collected by Joseph Jacobs, and the Finnish The Wonderful Birch. Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical Into the Woods. Giambattista Basile's Cenerentola combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in Katie Woodencloak, Rushen Coatie, Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, The Story of Tam and Cam, or The Sharp Grey Sheep—these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in The Golden Slipper, a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. Gioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola, in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as Katie Woodencloak and The Golden Slipper have her attend church.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty. However, on the third (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes. In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds—or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault's version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the Brothers Grimm, German: Aschenbroedel and Aschenputtel, for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. In Rossini's opera \"La Cenerentola\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (pantoufle de verre) had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (pantoufle de vair) in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.[26]  The 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual element—the Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a 'Droit du seigneur' right of sexual possession of his subjects. The disguised Cinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).\n",
      "\n",
      "The translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no particular reason. Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone. In Terry Pratchett's Witches Abroad, the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her. In \"When the Clock Strikes\" (from Red As Blood), Tanith Lee had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them.  In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother. The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.[27] The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds. In other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.\n",
      "\n",
      "In The Thousand Nights and A Night, in a tale called \"The Anklet\",[28] the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night. In The Wonderful Birch, the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an episode of Jim Henson's The Storyteller, writer Anthony Minghella merged the old folk tale Donkeyskin (also written by Perrault) with Cinderella to tell the tale of Sapsorrow, a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other. Examples are the film Ever After, Cinderella 3 and the Broadway revival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folklorists have long studied variants on this tale across cultures.[29] In 1893, Marian Roalfe Cox, commissioned by the Folklore Society of Britain, produced Cinderella: Three Hundred and Forty-Five Variants of Cinderella, Catskin and, Cap o'Rushes, Abstracted and Tabulated with a Discussion of Medieval Analogues and Notes.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Further morphology studies have continued on this seminal work.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Aarne–Thompson-Uther system classifies Cinderella as type 510A, \"Persecuted Heroine\". Others of this type include The Sharp Grey Sheep; The Golden Slipper; The Story of Tam and Cam; Rushen Coatie; The Wonderful Birch; Fair, Brown and Trembling; and Katie Woodencloak.[30]\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of Cinderella has formed the basis of many notable works:\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1804 Cinderella was presented at Drury Lane Theatre, London, described as \"A new Grand Allegorical Pantomimic Spectacle\" though it was very far in style and content from the modern pantomime.  However, it included notable clown Joseph Grimaldi playing the part of a servant called Pedro, the antecedant of today's character Buttons.[33]  In 1820 Harlequin and Cinderella at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden had much of the modern story (taken from the opera La Cenerentola) by Rossini but was a Harlequinade again featuring Grimaldi.[33]  In 1830 Rophino Lacy used Rossini's music but with spoken dialogue in a comic opera with many of the main characters: the Baron, the two stepsisters and Pedro the servant all as comic characters, plus a Fairy Queen instead of a magician.[33]  However it was the conversion of this via burlesque and rhyming couplets by Henry Byron which led to what was effectively the modern pantomime in both story and style at the Royal Strand Theatre in 1860: Cinderella! Or the Lover, the Lackey, and the Little Glass Slipper.[33]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the traditional pantomime version the opening scene takes place in a forest with a hunt in progress; here Cinderella first meets Prince Charming and his \"right-hand man\" Dandini, whose name and character come from Gioachino Rossini's opera (La Cenerentola). Cinderella mistakes Dandini for the Prince and the Prince for Dandini. Her father, Baron Hardup, is under the thumb of his two stepdaughters, the Ugly sisters, and has a servant, Cinderella's friend Buttons. (Throughout the pantomime, the Baron is continually harassed by the Broker's Men (often named after current politicians) for outstanding rent.) The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball. However, she must return by midnight, as it is then that the spell ceases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the decades, hundreds of films have been made that are either direct adaptations from Cinderella or have plots loosely based on the story.\n",

The Bad Zouave\\n\\nBiographical Note\\n\\nALPHONSE DAUDET was born at Nîmes in the south of France on May 13, 1840. His father was an\\nunsuccessful silk manufacturer, and his boyhood was far from happy. After a period of schooling at\\nLyons, he became at sixteen usher in a school, but before the end of the following year he abandoned a\\nprofession in which he found only misery. Going up to Paris he joined his elder brother, Ernest, who was\\nthen trying to get a foothold in journalism. At eighteen he published a volume of poems, “Les\\nAmoureuses,” wrote for the “Figaro,” and began experimenting with playwriting. He attracted the\\nattention of the Duc de Morny, who made him one of his secretaries and in various ways helped him to a\\nstart in life.\\n\\n  His first notable success came in 1866 with his “Lettres de mon Moulin,” a series of sketches and\\nstories of great charm and delicacy, and this was followed up by a longer work, “Le petit chose,” a\\n\\n\\x0cpathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youth. In 1872 he produced the first of his three volumes on\\nthe amazing “Tartarin of Tarascon,” probably the most vital of all his creations. In “Fromont jeune et\\nRisler aîné” he created another great character, Delobelle, the broken-down actor, and he took captive the\\nreading world by his combination of humor and pathos, and the vividness of his portraits of types. Pathos\\nwas again the chief characteristic of “Jack,” in which the life of a neglected boy at a school which recalls\\nthe establishment of Mr. Squeers is not the only parallel between Daudet and Dickens.\\n\\n  Daudet was now a successful writer of established reputation, and through the seventies and eighties he\\nwrote a succession of novels of a considerable variety of theme. Thus he dealt with the Paris of\\ndethroned monarchs in “Les Rois en exil”; with new millionaires in “Le Nabab”; with the talkative type\\nof his native South in “Numa Roumestan,” satirizing the statesman Gambetta; with the demimonde in\\n“Sapho”; while in “L’Immortel” he drew a scathing picture of the French Academy, which never\\nhonored itself by electing him to membership. “Tartarin” reappeared in all his buoyancy in “Tartarin sur\\nles Alpes,” and, less successfully as a colonist in “Port-Tarascon.” Some volumes of reminiscences, a\\nconsiderable number of short stories, some delightful tales for children, and a few plays complete the list\\nof his more important writings. He died at Paris on December 17, 1897.\\n\\n  Daudet was especially distinguished for his style. He wrote with a great impression of ease, yet he\\nobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity. He belonged to the realistic school, and though he\\nachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work of\\nsome of his colleagues.\\n\\n  None of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories, and the collection called “Contes du\\nlundi” from which the following examples are taken exhibit his power of restrained pathos at its height.\\nThe horrors of the Franco-Prussian War have been more terribly pictured on some larger canvases, but\\nno one has etched with more delicacy and sensitiveness the small private tragedies of that great disaster.\\n“The Siege of Berlin,” “The Last Class,” and “The Bad Zouave” are not only classics of the art of the\\nshort story; they contain the essence of French patriotism.\\n\\nW. A. N.\\n\\nCriticisms and Interpretations\\n\\nI. By Henry James\\n\\nTHE CHARM of Daudet’s talent comes from its being charged to an extraordinary degree with his\\ntemperament, his feelings, his instincts, his natural qualities. This, of course, is a charm in a style only\\nwhen nature has been generous. To Alphonse Daudet she has been exceptionally so; she has placed in his\\nhand an instrument of many chords. A delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite of\\nits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and with\\npain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, at\\nevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibility\\nto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderful\\nfineness of perception—these are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and which\\nmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.—From “Partial Portraits” (1888).\\n\\n\\x0cCriticisms and Interpretations\\n\\nII. By George Pellissier\\n\\nDAUDET works in a sort of fever. Even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, and\\nalmost “lived” them. This habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes his\\nprocess of composition. The original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version begins\\nwhat he calls the painful part of his labor. He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to his\\ntroubadour instincts. The subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paper\\nwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toiling\\nbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments. Only with that “trembling of the fingers,” with him\\na sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen. He at once launches into the full current of the action. As\\nhis figures are already “on foot in his mind,” he loses no time in introducing them in full activity. The\\ngreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.\\nThere are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains the\\nsituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actual\\nmise en scène. He renders only what moves his heart and sets his nerves in vibration—what is dramatic,\\npicturesque, and animated in human affairs.—From “The Literary Movement in France in the Nineteenth\\nCentury” (1893).\\n\\n1. The Siege of Berlin\\n\\nWE were going up Avenue des Champs-Elysées with Dr. V——, asking the shell-riddled walls, and the\\nsidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of Paris, when, just before we reached the\\nRond-point de l’Etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudly\\ngrouped about the Arc de Triomphe, said to me:\\n\\n  “Do you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony? In the early days of August, that\\nterrible August of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, I was called there to see a case of\\napoplexy. It was the apartment of Colonel Jouve, a cuirassier of the First Empire, an old enthusiast on the\\nsubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the Champs-Élysées, in an apartment with a\\nbalcony, at the outbreak of the war. Guess why? In order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.\\nPoor old fellow! The news of Wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table. When he read\\nthe name of Napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.\\n\\n  “I found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, and\\nas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe. He must have been very tall when he\\nwas standing; lying there, he looked enormous. Handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curly\\nwhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty. Beside him was his granddaughter, on her knees\\nand bathed in tears. She looked like him. One who saw them side by side might have taken them for two\\nbeautiful Greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a little\\nroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of a\\nfresh impression.\\n\\n  “The child’s grief touched me. Daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on MacMahon’s\\nstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image no\\n\\n\\x0cless terrible. I comforted her as best I could, but in reality I had little hope. We had to do with a case of\\ncomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it. For three days the\\npatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor. Then the news of Reichshofen reached Paris. You\\nremember in what a strange way it came. Up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twenty\\nthousand Prussians killed and the Prince Royal a prisoner. I know not by what miracle, what magnetic\\ncurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;\\nbut the fact is that on that evening, when I approached his bed, I did not find the same man there. His eye\\nwas almost clear, his tongue less heavy. He had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:\\n\\n  “‘Vic-to-ry!’\\n\\n  “And as I gave him details of the grand exploit of MacMahon, I saw that his features relaxed and his\\nface lighted up.\\n\\n  “When I left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death. She was sobbing.\\n\\n  “‘But he is saved!’ I said, taking her hands.\\n\\n  “The unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply. The true report of Reichshofen had been placarded;\\nMacMahon in retreat, the whole army crushed. We gazed at each other in consternation. She was in\\ndespair, thinking of her father. I trembled, thinking of the old man. He certainly could not stand this fresh\\nshock. And yet what were we to do? Leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him? But in\\nthat case we must lie.\\n\\n  “‘Very well, I will lie!’ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face she\\nentered her grandfather’s chamber.\\n\\n  “It was a hard task that she had undertaken. The first few days she had no great difficulty. The good\\nman’s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child. But with returning health his\\nideas became clearer. We had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw up\\nmilitary bulletins for him. Really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over her\\nmap of Germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: Bazaine\\nbesieging Berlin, Froissart in Bavaria, MacMahon on the Baltic. For all this she asked my advice, and I\\nassisted her as well as I could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in that\\nimaginary invasion. He had conquered Germany so many times under the First Empire! He knew all the\\nstrokes beforehand: ‘Now this is where they will go. Now this is what they will do’; and his anticipations\\nwere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.\\n\\n  “Unlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.\\nThat old man was insatiable! Every day, when I arrived, I learned of some new military exploit.\\n\\n  “‘Doctor, we have taken Mayence,’ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-broken\\nsmile, and I would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:\\n\\n  “‘They are getting on! They are getting on! In a week we shall be in Berlin!’\\n\\n  “At that moment the Prussians were only a week’s march from Paris. We asked ourselves at first if it\\nwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of the\\ncountry would have told him everything, and I considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by his\\ngreat shock, to let him know the truth. So we decided to remain.\\n\\n\\x0c  “The first day of the investment of Paris, I went up to their rooms, I remember, deeply moved, with that\\nagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned into\\nfrontiers, gave us all. I found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.\\n\\n  “‘Well,’ he said, ‘so the siege has begun!’\\n\\n  “I gazed at him in blank amazement.\\n\\n  “‘What, colonel! you know?’\\n\\n  “His granddaughter turned towards me:\\n\\n  “‘Why, yes, doctor, that’s the great news. The siege of Berlin has begun.’\\n\\n  “As she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air! How could he have suspected\\nanything? He could not hear the guns of the forts. He could not see our unfortunate Paris, all in confusion\\nand dreadful to behold. What he saw from his bed was a section of the Arc de Triomphe, and in his room,\\nabout him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the First Empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion. Portraits\\nof marshals, engravings of battles, the King of Rome in a baby’s dress, tall consoles adorned with copper\\ntrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of St. Helena, under a globe, pictures\\nrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and bright\\neyes;—and all these things: consoles, King of Rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,\\nshort-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806. Gallant colonel! It was that\\natmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made him\\nbelieve so innocently in the siege of Berlin.\\n\\n  “From that day our military operations were much simplified. To take Berlin was only a matter of\\npatience. From time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from his\\nson—an imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter Paris, and since Sedan,\\nMacMahon’s aide-de-camp had been sent to a German fortress. You can imagine the despair of that poor\\nchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,\\nand she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier on\\nthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country. Sometimes\\nher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks. But the old man became anxious, could\\nnot sleep. Thereupon a letter from Germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedside\\nand read joyously, forcing back her tears. The colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,\\napprove, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused. But where he was\\nespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son. ‘Never forget that you are a Frenchman,’ he\\nwould say to him. ‘Be generous to those poor people. Don’t make the invasion too hard for them.’ And\\nthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, the\\ncourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use of\\nconquerors. He interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to be\\nimposed upon the vanquished. Thereupon I must say that he was not exacting.\\n\\n  “‘A war indemnity, and nothing more. What is the use of taking their provinces? Is it possible to turn\\nGermany into France?’\\n\\n  “He dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,\\npatriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.\\n\\n\\x0c  “Meanwhile the siege went on—not the siege of Berlin, alas! It was the time of intense cold, of the\\nbombardment, of epidemics and of famine. But, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearying\\naffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man’s serenity was not disturbed for an instant. To\\nthe very end I was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him. There was none for anybody but\\nhim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, so\\ninnocently selfish—the old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and his\\ngranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, and\\nto eat all those forbidden good things. Then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,\\nthe winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier would\\nrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreat\\nfrom Russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.\\n\\n  “‘Do you understand that, my love? We had horseflesh!’\\n\\n  “I rather think that she did understand it. For two months she had had nothing else. From that day,\\nhowever, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.\\nThat numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began to\\ndisappear. Two or three times, the terrible volleys from Porte Maillot had made him jump, with his ears\\npricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of Bazaine under the walls of\\nBerlin, and guns fired in his honour at the Invalides. Another day when his bed had been moved to the\\nwindow—it was, I believe, the Thursday of Buzenval—he saw large numbers of National Guards\\ncollected on Avenue de la Grande Armée.\\n\\n  “‘What are all those troops?’ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:\\n\\n  “‘Poorly set up! Poorly set up!’\\n\\n  “That was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth. Unluckily we did not\\ntake enough.\\n\\n  “One evening when I arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.\\n\\n  “‘They are to march into the city to-morrow,’ she said.\\n\\n  “Was the grandfather’s door open? In truth, on thinking it over afterwards, I remembered that his face\\nwore an extraordinary expression that night. It is probable that he had overheard us. But we were talking\\nof the Prussians; and the good man was thinking of the French, of that triumphal entry which he had been\\nawaiting so long—MacMahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, his\\nson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at Lutzen, saluting the torn\\nflags and the eagles blackened by powder.\\n\\n  “Poor Father Jouve! He had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing that\\nparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement. So he was very careful not to mention it to\\nany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the Prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon the\\nlong road which leads from Porte Maillot to the Tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and the\\ncolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one of\\nMilhaud’s cuirassiers. I wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed him\\nthus upon his feet and in his harness. This much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,\\namazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, Paris as gloomy as a huge\\n\\n\\x0clazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet our\\nsoldiers.\\n\\n  “For a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.\\n\\n  “But no! Yonder, behind the Arc de Triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approaching\\nin the rising sunlight. Then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of Jena\\nbegan to beat, and beneath the Arc de Triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashing\\nof the sabres beat time, Schubert’s Triumphal March burst forth!\\n\\n  “Thereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‘To arms! To arms! The\\nPrussians!’ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave his\\narms, stagger, and fall. That time, Colonel Jouve was really dead.”\\n\\n2. The Last Class—The Story of a Little Alsatian\\n\\nI WAS very late for school that morning, and I was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially as\\nMonsieur Hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and I did not know the first thing\\nabout them. For a moment I thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields. It was\\nsuch a warm, lovely day. I could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in the\\nRippert field, behind the sawmill, the Prussians going through their drill. All that was much more\\ntempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but I had the strength to resist, and I ran as fast as I\\ncould to school.\\n\\n  As I passed the mayor’s office, I saw that there were people gathered about the little board on which\\nnotices were posted. For two years all our bad news had come from that board—battles lost,\\nconscriptions, orders from headquarters; and I thought without stopping:\\n\\n  “What can it be now?”\\n\\n  Then, as I ran across the square, Wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, reading\\nthe placard, called out to me:\\n\\n  “Don’t hurry so, my boy; you’ll get to your school soon enough!”\\n\\n  I thought that he was making fun of me, and I ran into Monsieur Hamel’s little yard all out of breath.\\n\\n  Usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desks\\nopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, and\\nthe teacher’s stout ruler beating on the desk:\\n\\n  “A little more quiet!”\\n\\n  I counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything was\\nquiet, like a Sunday morning. Through the open window I saw my comrades already in their places, and\\nMonsieur Hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had no open the door\\nand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence. You can imagine whether I blushed and whether I was\\nafraid!\\n\\n  But no! Monsieur Hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:\\n\\n\\x0c  “Go at once to your seat, my little Frantz; we were going to begin without you.”\\n\\n  I stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk. Not until then, when I had partly recovered\\nfrom my fright, did I notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the black\\nsilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.\\nMoreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class. But what\\nsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, some\\npeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old Hauser with his three-cornered hat, the\\nex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides. They all seemed depressed; and Hauser had brought an\\nold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectacles\\naskew.\\n\\n  While I was wondering at all this, Monsieur Hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentle\\nand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:\\n\\n  “My children, this is the last time that I shall teach you. Orders have come from Berlin to teach nothing\\nbut German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The new teacher arrives to-morrow. This is the last\\nclass in French, so I beg you to be very attentive.”\\n\\n  Those few words overwhelmed me. Ah! the villains! that was what they had posted at the mayor’s\\noffice.\\n\\n  My last class in French!\\n\\n  And I barely knew how to write! So I should never learn! I must stop short where I was! How angry I\\nwas with myself because of the time I had wasted, the lessons I had missed, running about after nests, or\\nsliding on the Saar! My books, which only a moment before I thought so tiresome, so heavy to\\ncarry—my grammar, my sacred history—seemed to me now like old friends, from whom I should be\\nterribly grieved to part. And it was the same about Monsieur Hamel. The thought that he was going\\naway, that I should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.\\n\\n  Poor man! It was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes; and I\\nunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room. It seemed to\\nmean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school. It was also a way of thanking our teacher\\nfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.\\n\\n  I was at that point in my reflections, when I heard my name called. It was my turn to recite. What would\\nI not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,\\ndistinct voice, without a slip! But I got mixed up at the first words, and I stood there swaying against my\\nbench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head. I heard Monsieur Hamel speaking to me:\\n\\n  “I will not scold you, my little Frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every day\\nwe say to ourselves: ‘Pshaw! I have time enough. I will learn to-morrow.’ And then you see what\\nhappens. Ah! it has been the great misfortune of our Alsace always to postpone its lessons until\\nto-morrow. Now those people are entitled to say to us: ‘What! you claim to be French, and you can\\nneither speak nor write your language!’ In all this, my poor Frantz, you are not the guiltiest one. We all\\nhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.\\n\\n  “Your parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated. They preferred to send you\\n\\n\\x0cto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous. And have I nothing to reproach\\nmyself for? Have I not often made you water my garden instead of studying? And when I wanted to go\\nfishing for trout, have I ever hesitated to dismiss you?”\\n\\n  Then, passing from one thing to another, Monsieur Hamel began to talk to us about the French\\nlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the most\\nsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a people\\nfalls into servitude, “so long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.” 1 Then he\\ntook the grammer and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how readily I understood. Everything that\\nhe said seemed so easy to me, so easy. I believed, too, that I had never listened so closely, and that he, for\\nhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations. One would have said that, before going away,\\nthe poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.\\n\\n  When the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing. For that day Monsieur Hamel had prepared some\\nentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: “France, Alsace, France, Alsace.”\\nThey were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks. You should\\nhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was! Nothing could be heard save the grinding of the\\npens over the paper. At one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, not\\neven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientious\\napplication, as if even the lines were French. On the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,\\nand I said to myself as I listened to them:\\n\\n  “I wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in German too!”\\n\\n  From time to time, when I raised my eyes from my paper. I saw Monsieur Hamel sitting motionless in\\nhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of his\\nlittle schoolhouse. Think of it! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in front\\nof him and his class just as it was! But the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; the\\nwalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned the\\nwindows even to the roof. What a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave all\\nthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks! For\\nthey were to go away the next day—to leave the province forever.\\n\\n  However, he had the courage to keep the class to the end. After the writing, we had the lesson in\\nhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu. Yonder, at the back of the room, old\\nHauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letters\\nwith them. I could see that he too was applying himself. His voice shook with emotion, and it was so\\nfunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry. Ah! I shall remember that last class.\\n\\n  Suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the Angelus rang. At the same moment, the bugles of the\\nPrussians returning from drill blared under our windows. Monsieur Hamel rose, pale as death, from his\\nchair. Never had he seemed to me so tall.\\n\\n  “My friends,” he said, “my friends, I—I—”\\n\\n  But something suffocated him. He could not finish the sentence.\\n\\n  Thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, he\\nwrote in the largest letters he could:\\n\\n\\x0c  “VIVE LA FRANCE!”\\n\\n  Then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to us\\nwith his hand:\\n\\n  “That is all; go.”\\n\\nHIS name was Stenne, little Stenne.\\n\\n3. The Child Spy\\n\\n  He was a child of Paris, sickly and pale, who might have been ten years old, perhaps fifteen; with those\\nurchins one can never tell. His mother was dead; his father, formerly in the navy, was keeper of a square\\nin he Temple quarter. Babies, nurse-maids, old ladies in reclining-chairs, poor mothers, all of toddling\\nParis that seeks shelter from vehicles in those flower-gardens bordered by paths, knew Father Stenne and\\nadored him. They knew that beneath that rough mustache, the terror of dogs and of loiterers, lay\\nconcealed a kind, melting, almost maternal smile, and that, in order to see that smile one had only to ask\\nthe good man:\\n\\n  “How’s your little boy?”\\n\\n  Father Stenne was so fond of his boy! He was so happy in the afternoon, after school, when the little\\nfellow came for him and they made together the circuit of the paths, stopping at each bench to salute the\\noccupants and to answer their kind words.\\n\\n  Unfortunately with the siege everything changed. Father Stenne’s square was closed, petroleum was\\nstored there, and the poor man, forced to keep watch all the time, passed his life among the deserted and\\nneglected shrubs, alone, unable to smoke, and without the company of his boy except very late at night,\\nat home. So that you should have seen his mustache when he mentioned the Prussians. As for little\\nStenne, he did not complain’ very much of that new life.\\n\\n  A siege! It is such an amusing thing for urchins. No school! No lessons! Vacation all the time and the\\nstreet like a fair.\\n\\n  The child stayed out of doors, wandering about until night. He followed the battalions of the quarter\\nwhen they went to the fortifications, choosing by preference those which had a good band; and upon that\\nsubject little Stenne was well posted. He could tell you that the band of the 96th did not amount to much,\\nbut that in the 55th they had a fine one. At other times he watched the troops go through the drill; then\\nthere were the lines at the shopdoors.\\n\\n  With his basket on his arm, he stood in the long lines that formed in the dark winter mornings, without\\ngas, at the doors of the butchers’ and bakers’ shops. There, with their feet in the water, people became\\nacquainted, talked politics, and every one asked his advice, as M. Stenne’s son. But the games of\\nbouchon were the most amusing thing of all, and that famous game of galoche, which the Breton militia\\nhad brought into fashion during the siege. When little Stenne was not at the fortifications, or at the\\nbaker’s, you were sure to find him at the game on Place du Château d’Eau. He did not play, you\\nunderstand; it required too much money. He contented himself with watching the players, with such\\neyes!\\n\\n\\x0c  One especially, a tall youth in a blue blouse, who bet nothing less than five-franc pieces, aroused his\\nadmiration. When he ran you could hear the money jingling in his pockets.\\n\\n  One day, as he picked up a coin which had rolled to little Stenne’s feet, the tall youth said to him in an\\nundertone:\\n\\n  “That makes you squint, eh? Well, I will tell you where they are to be found, if you want.”\\n\\n  When the game was ended he led him to a corner of the square and proposed to him to go with him to\\nsell newspapers to the Prussians; he received thirty francs per trip. At first Stenne refused, highly\\nindignant; and he actually stayed away from the game for three days. Three terrible days. He did not eat,\\nhe did not sleep. At night, he saw piles of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five-franc pieces lying flat,\\nall glistening. The temptation was too great. On the fourth day he returned to the Château d’Eau, saw the\\ntall youth again, and allowed himself to be persuaded.\\n\\n  They set out one snowy morning, a canvas bag over their shoulders and newspapers hidden under their\\nblouses, When they reached the Flanders gate it was barely light. The tall youth took Stenne by the hand,\\nand, approaching the sentry—an honest volunteer with a red nose and a good-natured expression—he\\nsaid to him in the whining voice of a pauper:\\n\\n  “Let us pass, my kind monsieur. Our mother is sick, papa is dead, I am going out with my little brother\\nto pick up potatoes in the fields.”\\n\\n  And he wept. Stenne, covered with shame, hung his head. The sentry looked at them a moment, and\\ncast a glance at the deserted road.\\n\\n  “Hurry up,” he said, stepping aside; and there they were upon the Aubervilliers Road. How the tall\\nfellow laughed!\\n\\n  Confusedly, as in a dream, little Stenne saw factories transformed into barracks, abandoned barricades\\ncovered with wet rags, long chimneys cutting the mist and rising into the sky, smokeless and broken. At\\nintervals, a sentry, beplumed officers looking into the distance with field-glasses, and small tents\\ndrenched with melted snow in front of dying fires. The tall fellow knew the roads and cut across the\\nfields to avoid the outposts. However, they fell in with a patrol of sharp-shooters, whom they could not\\navoid. The sharp-shooters were in their little cabins, perched on the edge of a ditch filled with water,\\nalong the Soissons railroad. That time the tall fellow repeated his story in vain; they would not allow\\nthem to pass. Then, while he was complaining, an old sergeant, all wrinkled and grizzled, who resembled\\nFather Stenne, came out of the guardhouse to the road.\\n\\n  “Come, little brats, I wouldn’t cry!” he said to the children; “we’ll let you go to get your potatoes, but\\ncome in and warm yourselves a little first. This little fellow looks as if he was frozen!”\\n\\n  Alas! It was not with cold that little Stenne was trembling—it was with fear, with shame. In the\\nguard-house they found several soldiers crouching about a paltry fire, a genuine widow’s fire, by the heat\\nof which they were thawing out biscuit on the points of their bayonets. They moved closer together to\\nmake room for the children. They gave them a little coffee. While they have were drinking, an officer\\ncame to the door, called to the sergeant, spoke to him in an undertone and hurried away.\\n\\n  “MY boys,” said the sergeant, returning with a radiant face, “there will be something up to-night. They\\nhave found out the Prussians’ countersign. I believe that this time we shall capture that infernal Bourget\\n\\n\\x0cagain.”\\n\\n  There was a explosion of cheers and laughter. They danced and sang and brandished their\\nsword-bayonets; and the children, taking advantage of the tumult, disappeared.\\n\\n  When they had passed the railway there was nothing before them but a level plain, and in the distance a\\nlong, blank wall, riddled with loopholes. It was towards that wall that they bent their steps, stooping\\nconstantly to make it appear that they were picking up potatoes.\\n\\n  “Let’s go back, let’s not go on,” said little Stenne again and again.\\n\\n  The other shrugged his shoulders and kept on. Suddenly they heard the click of a gun being cocked.\\n\\n  “Lie down!” said the tall fellow, throwing himself on the ground.\\n\\n  When they were down, he whistled. Another whistled. Another whistle answered over the snow. They\\ncrawled on. In front of the wall, level with the ground, appeared a pair of yellow mustaches beneath a\\nsoiled cap. The tall youth jumped into the trench, beside the Prussian.\\n\\n  “This is my brother,” he said, pointing to his companion.\\n\\n  Little Stenne was so little, that at the sight of him the Prussian began to laugh, and he was obliged to\\ntake him in his arms to lift him up to the breach.\\n\\n  On the other side of the wall were great piles of earth, felled trees, black holes in the snow, and in each\\nhole the same dirty cap and the same yellow mustaches, laughing when they saw the children pass.\\n\\n  In the corner was a gardener’s house casemated with trunks of trees. The lower room was full of\\nsoldiers playing cards, and cooking soup over a big, blazing fire. The cabbages and pork smelled good;\\nwhat a contrast to the bivouac of the sharp-shooters! Above were the officers. They could hear them\\nplaying the piano and opening champagne. When the Parisian entered, a joyous cheer greeted them. They\\nproduced their newspapers; then they were given drink and were induced to talk. All the officers had a\\nhaughty and disdainful manner; but the tall youth amused them with his faubourgian wit, his street\\nArab’s vocabulary. They laughed, repeated his phrases after him, and wallowed with delight in the\\nParisian mud which he brought them.\\n\\n  Little Stenne would have liked to talk too, to prove that he was not stupid, but something embarrassed\\nhim. Opposite him, apart from the rest, was an older and graver Prussian, who was reading, or rather\\nseemed to be reading, for his eyes did not leave little Stenne. Affection and reproach were in his glance\\nas if he had at home a child of the same age as Stenne, and as if he were saying to himself:\\n\\n  “I would rather die than see my son engaged in such business.”\\n\\n  From that moment Stenne felt as it were a hand resting on his heart, which prevented it from beating.\\n\\n  To escape that torture, he began to drink. Soon everything about him whirled around. He heard vaguely,\\namid loud laughter, his comrade making fun of the National Guards, of their manner of drilling; he\\nimitated a call to arms in the Marais, a night alarm on the ramparts. Then the tall fellow lowered his\\nvoice, the officers drew nearer to him, and their faces became serious. The villain was warning them of\\nthe attack of the sharp-shooters.\\n\\n\\x0c  At that little Stenne sprang to his feet in a rage, thoroughly sober:\\n\\n  “Not that! I won’t have it!”\\n\\n  But the other simply laughed and kept on. Before he had finished, all the officers were standing. One of\\nthem pointed to the door and said to the children:\\n\\n  “Clear out!”\\n\\n  And they began to talk among themselves very rapidly, in German.\\n\\n  The tall youth went out as proud as a prince, jingling his money. Stenne followed him, hanging his\\nhead; and when he passed the Prussian whose glance had embarrassed him so, he heard a sad voice say:\\n\\n  “Not a nice thing to do, that. Not a nice thing.”\\n\\n  Tears came to his eyes.\\n\\n  Once in the field, the children began to run and returned quickly to the city. Their bag was full of\\npotatoes which the Prussians had given them. With them they passed unhindered to the trench of the\\nsharp-shooters. There they were preparing for the night attack. Troops came up silently and massed\\nbehind the walls. The old sergeant was there, busily engaged in posting his men, with such a happy\\nexpression. When the children passed, he recognised them and bestowed a pleasant smile upon them.\\n\\n  Oh! how that smile hurt little Stenne! For a moment he was tempted to call out:\\n\\n  “Don’t go there; we have betrayed you.”\\n\\n  But the other had told him: “If you speak we shall be shot”; and fear restrained him.\\n\\n  At La Courneuve, they entered an abandoned house to divide the money. Truth compels me to state that\\nthe division was made honestly, and that little Stenne’s crime did not seem so terrible to him when he\\nheard the coins jingling under his blouse, and thought of the games of galoche which he had in prospect.\\n\\n  But when he was alone, the wretched child! When the tall fellow had left him at the gate, then his\\npockets began to be very heavy, and the hand that grasped his heart grasped it tighter than ever. Paris did\\nnot seem the same to him. The people who passed gazed sternly at him as if they knew whence he came.\\nHe heard the word “spy” in the rumbling of the wheels, in the beating of the drums along the canal. At\\nlast he reached home, and, overjoyed to find that his father was not there, he went quickly up to their\\nroom, to hide under his pillow that money that weighed so heavily upon him.\\n\\n  Never had Father Stenne been so joyous and so good-humoured as when he returned that night. News\\nhad been received from the provinces: affairs were looking better. As he ate, the old soldier looked at his\\nmusket hanging on the wall, and said to the child with his hearty laugh:\\n\\n  “I say, my boy, how you would go at the Prussians if you were big!”\\n\\n  Above eight o’clock, they heard cannon.\\n\\n  “That is Aubervilliers. They are fighting at Bourget,” said the good man, who knew all the forts. Little\\nStenne turned pale, and, on the plea that he was very tired, he went to bed; but he did not sleep. The\\ncannon still roared. He imagined the sharp-shooters arriving in the dark to surprise the Prussians, and\\n\\n\\x0cthemselves falling into an ambush. He remembered the sergeant who had smiled at him and he saw him\\nstretched out on the snow, and many others with him. The price of all that blood was concealed there\\nunder his pillow, and it was he, the son of Monsieur Stenne, of a soldier—tears choked him. In the\\nadjoining room he heard his father walk to the window and open it. Below on the square, the recall was\\nsounding; and a battalion was forming to leave the city. Evidently it was a real battle. The unhappy child\\ncloud not restrain a sob.\\n\\n  “What’s the matter with you?” asked Father Stenne as he entered the room.\\n\\n  The child could not stand it any longer; he leaped out of bed and threw himself at his father’s feet. At\\nthe movement that he made the silver pieces rolled on the floor.\\n\\n  “What is all this? Have you been stealing?” demanded the old man, trembling.\\n\\n  Thereupon, without pausing for breath, little Stenne told him that he had been to the Prussian quarters\\nand of what he had done there.\\n\\n  As he spoke, his heart felt freer; it relieved him to accuse himself. Father Stenne listened, with a terrible\\nface. When it was at an end, he hid face in his hands and wept.\\n\\n  “Father, father—” the child began.\\n\\n  The old man pushed him away without replying, and picked up the money.\\n\\n  “Is this all?” he asked.\\n\\n  Little Stenne motioned that it was all. The old man took down his musket and cartridge box, and said as\\nhe put the money in his pocket:\\n\\n  “All right; I am going to return it to them.”\\n\\n  And without another word, without even turning his head, he went down and joined the troops who\\nwere marching away in the darkness. He was never seen again.\\n\\n4. The Game of Billiards\\n\\nAS they have been fighting two days, and have passed the night with their knapsacks on, beneath a flood\\nof rain, the soldiers are completely exhausted. And yet for three mortal hours they have been left waiting,\\nwith grounded arms, in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fields.\\n\\n  Benumbed by fatigue, by sleepless nights, and with their uniforms drenched with rain, they crowd\\ntogether to warm and comfort one another. There are some who sleep standing, leaning against a\\nneighbour’s knapsack, and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed faces,\\novercome with sleep. Rain, mud, no fire, nothing to eat, a low, black sky, and the enemy in the air about.\\nIt is funereal.\\n\\n  What are they doing there? What is going on? The guns, with their muzzles pointed towards the wood,\\nhave the appearance of watching something. The mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the horizon.\\nEverything seems ready for an attack. Why do they not attack? What are they waiting for?\\n\\n  They are awaiting orders, and headquarters sends none. And yet the headquarters are not far away. They\\n\\n\\x0care at yonder stately Louis-Treize château, whose red bricks, scoured by the rain, glisten among the trees\\nhalf-way up the hill. Truly a princely dwelling, quite worthy to bear the banner of a marshal of France.\\nBehind a broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road, smooth green lawns, lined with\\nvases of flowers, extend to the porch. On the other side, the private side of the house, the hornbeam\\nhedges show luminous gaps; the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror, and beneath the\\npagodalike roof of an enormous aviary, peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and display\\ntheir plumage, uttering shrill cries amid the foliage. Although the owners have gone away, one does not\\nfeel the abandonment, the desolation of war. The oriflamme of the leader of the army has safeguarded\\neven the tiniest flowers in the lawns, and it is an impressive thing to find so near the battle-field that\\nopulent tranquillity that is born of perfect order, of the accurate alignment of the shrubbery, of the silent\\ndepths of the avenues.\\n\\n  The rain, which fills the roads yonder with such disgusting mud, and digs such deep ruts, here is\\nnothing more than an elegant, aristocratic shower, reviving the red of the bricks and the green of the\\nlawns, polishing the leaves of the orange-trees and the white feathers of the swans. Everything glistens,\\neverything is peaceful. Really, but for the flag floating on the roof, but for the two soldiers on sentry-go\\nbefore the gate, one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an army. The horses are resting in\\nthe stables. Here and there one sees a groom, or an orderly in undress uniform, loitering about the\\nkitchen, or a gardener in red trousers placidly drawing his rake over the gravel in the great courtyards.\\n\\n  The dining-room, the windows of which look upon the porch, discloses a half-cleared table; uncorked\\nbottles, soiled and empty glasses on the rumpled cloth; the end of a banquet, after the guests have gone.\\nIn the adjoining room one may hear loud voices, laughter, the clicking of balls and the clinking of\\nglasses. The marshal is playing his game of billiards, and that is why the army is waiting for orders.\\nWhen the marshal had begun his game, the heavens might fall, but nothing in the world could prevent\\nhim from finishing it.\\n\\n  Billiards! that is the weakness of that great warrior. He stands there, as grave as in battle, in full\\nuniform, his breast covered with medals, with kindled eyes, flushed cheeks, excited by feasting, grog,\\nand the game. His aides-de-camp surround him, zealous and respectful. uttering admiring exclamations at\\neach of his strokes. When the marshal makes a point, they all hasten to mark it; when the marshal is\\nthirsty, they all rush to prepare his grog. There is a constant rustling of epaulettes and plumes, a jingling\\nof medals; and to see all those sweet smiles, those artful, courtierlike reverences, all those new uniforms\\nand embroidery in that lofty apartment, with its oaken wainscoting, looking upon parks and courts of\\nhonour, recalls the autumn days at Compiègne, and affords the eyes a little rest from the stained cloaks\\nthat shiver yonder along the roads, forming such sombre groups in the rain.\\n\\n  The marshal’s opponent is a young captain of the staff, belted and curled and light-gloved, who is in the\\nfirst rank of billiard-players and capable of beating all the marshals on earth; but he has the tact to keep a\\nrespectful distance behind his chief, and devotes his energies to the task of not winning, and at the same\\ntime not losing too easily. He is what is called an officer with a future.\\n\\n  Attention, young man, let us be on our guard! The marshal has fifteen, and you ten. The point is to keep\\nthe game in that condition to the end; then you will have done more for your promotion than if you were\\noutside with the others, beneath those torrents of water which drown the horizon, soiling your natty\\nuniform, tarnishing the gold of your aiguillettes, awaiting orders which do not come.\\n\\n  It is really an interesting game. The balls roll and clash and mingle their colours. The cushions send\\n\\n\\x0cthem merrily back; the cloth waxes hot. Suddenly the flash of a cannon-shot passes across the sky. A dull\\nsound rattles the windows. Everybody starts, and they look at each other anxiously. The marshal alone\\nhas neither seen nor heard anything; leaning over the table, he is busily engaged in planning a\\nmagnificent draw-shot; draw-shots are his strong point.\\n\\n  But there comes another flash, then another. The cannon-shots succeed each other in hot haste. The\\naides-de-camp run to the windows. Can it be that the Prussians are attacking.\\n\\n  “Very well, let them attack!” says the marshal, chalking his cue. “It’s your turn, captain.”\\n\\n  The staff quivers with admiration. Turenne asleep upon a gun-carriage was nothing compared to this\\nmarshal, who plays billiards so tranquilly at the moment of going into action. Meanwhile the uproar\\nredoubles. With the roar of the cannon is mingled the tearing sound of the mitrailleuses, the rattle of\\nmusketry. A red steam, black at the edges, rises around the lawns. The whole park is on fire. The terrified\\npeacocks and pheasants shriek in the aviary; the Arabian horses, smelling the powder, rear in the stables.\\nThe headquarters begins to be excited. Despatch after despatch. Couriers arrive at full speed. They ask\\nfor the marshal.\\n\\n  The marshal cannot be seen. Did I not tell you that nothing could prevent him from finishing his game?\\n\\n  “It is your turn, captain.”\\n\\n  But the captain is distraught. That is what it is to be young. Behold he loses his head, forgets his tactics,\\nand makes two runs in succession, which almost give him the game. Thereupon the marshal becomes\\nfurious. Surprise and indignation animate his manly face. Just at this moment a horse ridden at a hard\\ngallop rushes into the courtyard. An aide-de-camp covered with mud forces his way past the sentries and\\nascends the steps at one bound. “Marshal, marshal!” You should see how he is greeted. Puffing with\\nanger and red as a rooster, the marshal appears at the window, his billiard-cue in his hand:\\n\\n  “What’s the matter? What’s all this? Isn’t there any sentry there?”\\n\\n  “But, marshal——”\\n\\n  “All right, in a moment; wait for my orders, in God’s name!”\\n\\n  And the window is violently closed.\\n\\n  Wait for his orders! That is just what they are doing, the poor fellows. The wind drives the rain and the\\ngrapeshot full in their faces. Whole battalions are wiped out, while others stand useless, with their arms\\nin readiness, utterly unable to understand their inaction. Nothing to do. They are awaiting orders.\\nHowever, as one needs no orders to die, the men fall by hundreds behind the shrubs, in the moats, in\\nfront of the great silent château. Even after they have fallen, the grape tears them still, and from the open\\nwounds the generous blood of France flows noiselessly. Above, in the billiard-room, it is getting terribly\\nwarm too; the marshal has recovered his lead, but the little captain is defending himself like a lion.\\n\\n  Seventeen! eighteen! nineteen!\\n\\n  They hardly have time to mark the points. The roar of the battle draws nearer. The marshal has but one\\nmore to go. Already shells are falling in the park. Suddenly one bursts over the pond. The mirror is\\nshattered; a swan in deadly alarm swims wildly about amid an eddy of bloody feathers. That is the last\\n\\n\\x0cstroke.\\n\\n  Then, a profound silence. Only the rain falling on the hedges, a confused rumbling at the foot of the hill,\\nand, along the muddy roads, a sound like the trampling of a hurrying flock. The army is in full retreat.\\nThe marshal has won his game.\\n\\n5. The Bad Zouave\\n\\nTHAT evening the big blacksmith, Lory of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, was not happy.\\n\\n  When the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set, it was his custom to sit on a bench before his\\ndoor, tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day’s work. Before\\nhe sent home his apprentices, he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them, while he\\nwatched the workers coming out of the factories.\\n\\n  But that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper, and even\\nthen he went as if he regretted to leave. As his old wife looked at him, she thought.\\n\\n  “What can have happened to him? Can he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding it\\nfrom me? Perhaps the older of the boys is sick——”\\n\\n  But she dared not question him, and busied herself quieting three little tow-headed rascals, brown as\\nears of parched corn, who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of black\\nradishes and cream.\\n\\n  At last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried,\\n\\n  “Ah, what brutes, what curs!”\\n\\n  “Come, Lory, who are you talking about?” said his wife. He shouted,\\n\\n  “I am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in their French\\nuniforms, arm in arm with the Bavarians—more of those fellows who have—how do they say\\nit?—‘chosen Prussian citizenship.’ And to think that every day we seeing such false Alsatians come\\nback! What can they have given the scoundrels to drink anyway?”\\n\\n  The mother tried to defend them.\\n\\n  “My poor husband, what do you expect? Those boys are not entirely to blame. They are sent to Algeria,\\nso far away in Africa! They get home-sick out there, and their temptation is very strong to come back and\\nnot be soldiers any longer.”\\n\\n  Lory struck the table a heavy blow with his fist.\\n\\n  “Be still, mother! You women-folk understand nothing at all. You live so much with children and so\\nlittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubs. I tell you, those fellows are\\nragamuffins, renegades, the worst sort of scoundrels! If bad luck ever made our own Christian capable of\\nsuch infamous conduct, as surely as my name is George Lory, seven years chasseur in the army of\\nFrance, I would run him through the body with my saber!”\\n\\n  Terrible to look upon, he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur’s saber, which hung\\n\\n\\x0cunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave, taken out there in Africa.\\n\\n  But merely to look at that honest Alsatian face,—burned almost black by the sun, the strong light\\nmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness around—that was enough to quiet him\\nsuddenly. He began to laugh.\\n\\n  “I am a fine fellow to be losing my head this way! As if our Christian could dream of turning\\nPrussian—Christian, who bowled over such a lot of them in the war!”\\n\\n  Brought back to good humour by this idea, the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal, and set\\nout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the Ville de Strasbourg.\\n\\n  The old woman was now left alone. She had put the small blond scamps to bed; they could be heard\\ntwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleep. She picked up her work, and set\\nto darning before the door on the garden side of the house. Once in a while she sighed, and she thought,\\n\\n  “Of course—there can be no doubt of it—they are scoundrels and renegades—but, what of it? Their\\nmothers are glad to see them again.”\\n\\n  And she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just at\\nthat hour of the day, getting ready to work in the garden. She looked at the well where he refilled his\\nwatering cans: her boy, in his blouse, with his long hair, that beautiful hair which had been cut short\\nwhen he entered the Zouaves.\\n\\n  Suddenly she trembled. The little gate at the back—the gate which led to the fields,—had been opened.\\nThe dogs had not barked, though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief, and\\nslipped in among the beehives.\\n\\n  “Good-day, mother!”\\n\\n  His uniform all awry, there stood before her Christian, her son, anxious, shame-faced, and\\nthick-tongued. The wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowling\\nabout the house, waiting for his father to go out. She wanted to scold him, but she had not the courage.\\nHow long it was since she had seen him, had hugged him! And then he went on to give her such good\\nreasons for his return!—how he had grown weary for his native countryside, for the smithy:—weary of\\nliving always so far away from them all, and of the discipline—much harsher of late—as well as of his\\ncomrades, who called him “Prussian” because of his Alsatian accent. She believed every word he said.\\nShe had only to look at him to believe him. Deep in their talk, they went into the lower room. The little\\nones woke up, and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brother. He was urged to eat,\\nbut he was not hungry. He was only thirsty, always thirsty; and he gulped great draughts of water on top\\nof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the inn.\\n\\n  But some one was coming into the yard. It was the black-smith returning.\\n\\n  “Christian, here comes your father. Quick, hide until I have time to talk with him and explain.”\\n\\n  She pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with trembling\\nhands. But as ill fortune would have it, the Zouave’s cap lay upon the table, and it was the first thing\\nLory noticed as he entered. The mother’s pallor, and her agitation—he understood it all.\\n\\n\\x0c  “Christian is here!” he cried, in a terrible voice. Taking down his saber with a mad gesture, he rushed\\ntowards the stove where crouched the Zouave, pale, sobered, and steadying himself against the wall to\\nkeep from falling.\\n\\n  The mother threw herself between them.\\n\\n  “Lory, Lory! Don’t kill him! He came back because I wrote that you needed him at the forge!”\\n\\n  She riveted her hold upon his arm, and dragged him back, sobbing. The children, in the darkness of\\ntheir room, began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears, and so thick that they did\\nnot know them.\\n\\n  The smith stood still and looked at his wife.\\n\\n  “Oh!” he said. “So it was you who made him come back! Very well. It is time he went to bed. I shall\\ndecide to-morrow what I must do.”\\n\\n  Christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors, to\\nfind himself in the room he had used as a child. Already warm and well up in the sky, the sun sent its\\nrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the window. Hammers were\\nringing on the anvil below. His mother sat by his pillow: she had been so afraid of her husband’s anger\\nthat she had not stirred from there all night. Nor had the father gone to bed. Till the first dawn, he had\\nwalked through the house weeping, sighing, opening and closing closets. He now entered his son’s room.\\nHe was very grave and dressed for a journey. He wore his high gaiters and his big hat, and carried his\\nheavy mountain stick with its iron ferule. He went straight to the bed.\\n\\n  “Come, get up!”\\n\\n  Dazed, the boy made as if to get his Zouave equipment.\\n\\n  “No, not that!” said the father, sternly.\\n\\n  The mother, all apprehension, said,\\n\\n  “But, my dear, he has no other things.”\\n\\n  “Give him mine. I shall not need them again.”\\n\\n  While the boy dressed, Lory carefully packed the uniform, with its little vest and its huge red trousers.\\nAs soon as he had made the package, he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule of\\ncoaches.\\n\\n  “Now let us go down,” he said; and all three without a word descended to the smithy.\\n\\n  The blast roared. Everyone was at work. When Christian saw once more that great open shed of which\\nhe had so often thought off there in Algeria, he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had played\\nout there, between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dust.\\nHe felt a sudden flood of tenderness, a great longing to be pardoned by his father; but whenever he raised\\nhis eyes, he met an inexorable look.\\n\\n  At last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak.\\n\\n\\x0c  “Boy,” he said, “there stands the anvil with the tools. They are all yours. And so is all this.” He\\nindicated the little garden which lay beyond, filled with sunshine and with bees, and framed by the sooty\\nsquare of the door.\\n\\n  “The hives, the vine, the house itself,—they are all yours. You sacrificed your honour for these things.\\nThe least you can do is to take care of them. Now you are master here. As for myself, I shall go away.\\nYou owe five years to France: I am going to pay them for you.”\\n\\n  “Lory, Lory!’ cried the poor old wife, “where are you going?”\\n\\n  “Father!” begged the son.\\n\\n  But the blacksmith was already on his way. He walked with great strides and did not turn back.\\n\\n  At Sidi-bel-Abbés, the dépôt of the Third Zouaves, there enlisted some days later a volunteer who gave\\nhis age as fifty-five years.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\nNote 1.  “S’il tient sa langue, il tient la clé qui de ses chaines le delivre.”—Mistral.
