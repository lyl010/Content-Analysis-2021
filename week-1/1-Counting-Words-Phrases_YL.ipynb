    "# Week 1 - Counting Words & Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words, simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use the Davies Corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we will be using the following packages:\n"

    "Let's look at what the code chunk above does. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, \"def\" function literally defines a function. You can call the function that you defined by using the function name, which is, here, loadcorpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it might be obvious, but, in Python, + operator is used when you combine literal strings or string variables. So, \"corpus_name\" + \"/\" gets you \"corpus_name/\". For example, in my case, the corpus_name is 'Users/hyunkukwon/Downloads/Movies'; so, corpus_name + \"/\" gives me '/Users/hyunkukwon/Downloads/Movies/'. By the way, why do we use \"\" here? This is because / is an operator in itself. Using \"\" makes / a string rather than an operator. Just to let you know, you can use type() to see what's the type of something. For example, if you write type(corpus_name), it'll get you 'string'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the \"os.listdir\" function is used to get the list of files in the specified directory. So, here we're trying to get all the files in the directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we have some problems here: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) first problem is that we do not want to load all the files in this directory; we want to load the files that have 'text' in the file name. So, we use the \"if corpus_style in file:\" to get the files that have the textual characteristics that we specified when we defined the function (corpus_style = \"text\"). Just to clarify, specifying the corpus_style does not get us the txt. files (in other words, it's not about the file extension). \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) second problem is that the files we have are zip files. So, we should unzip it so that we can get them on Python. That's why we use ZipFile, a class of zipfile module. We use ZipFile to read and write zip files. Then we use namelist() function, which returns the list of archive members by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, append() function adds an item at the end of the list. Here, we make an empty list by doing \"texts_raw[file] = []\"; and then we open the file, get every line in the file, and then append it to the empty list. The for loop does the iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, we used something similar above: \"texts_raw = {}\". But they're different: {} is a dictionary, while [] is a list. "

If I did n\\'t think ... you were the swellest jane in the world , I never would have given you a tumble . For me , nothing but the best , see ? So if you \\'ve got any idea in your nut that I \\'m the kind of guy ... runs around asking any jane to marry him , you \\'re crazy . Oh , gee , Eddie , you \\'re a scream . Why , you can-you can even make a fight out of a proposal of marriage . But you ai n\\'t kiddin \\' me . You try to make out you \\'re hard-boiled ... but you \\'re not really . Why , you \\'ve got a heart as big as anything . - And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fella a girl can depend on . I was in love with you almost the first time we met .

Jim come over to my house about an hour ago to see if you were there . He was worried about you , so I came back here with him . I , um - I could n\\'t remember the name of that hospital ... you said you were going to to visit that girl . She must be worse , huh ? Your staying there until almost 4:00 . You mean well , Edna , but that \\'s a lot of hooey . - Where were ya ? - Where do you think , Edna ? - I \\'m gon na get married . - No . So , it \\'s as bad as that , huh ? What do you mean it \\'s as bad as that ? I thought girls brought their fellas around and showed them off first to their families . They do in families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , not that you \\'d have brains enough to know it ... but I \\'ve been a pretty good brother to you , see ? I \\'ve been a father and a mother to ya . I \\'m supporting this house . And you \\'ve got some nerve comin \\' in at 4:00 in the morning ... tellin \\' me that you \\'re gon na get married . Why do you object ? You do n\\'t even know the fella . No , but I \\'m going to . Bring him around . Let him meet your family , like any decent fella would want to do . And after a while , if I think he \\'s all right ... you can marry him . - After a while ? - Oh , that gets a rise out of you , does it ? I thought it would . One of them rush marriages . - What do you mean ? - You know what I mean . - You do n\\'t know that I did anything wrong . - I can put two and two together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can prove that you \\'re not . You tell me that you \\'ll wait , or I \\'ll know that you got ta marry this guy . And if that \\'s the case , I do n\\'t want you in the house . - Now , what do you think about that ? - Where \\'ll I go ? Go back where you come from , you little tramp . And get out now . You wo n\\'t take any clothes with you either . I paid for every rag you got on your back . Go on . Get out . You deserve everything you \\'re gettin \\' . Sure does . A girl brought up under the influence of a fine brother like you got . You \\'ll probably end up in the streets . That \\'s what you got in your mind , ai n\\'t it , Jim ? And I wo n\\'t be sorry for her either . No , I do n\\'t expect you to be sorry for her , Jim . But let her have her clothes . - I paid for \\' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let her find out there ai n\\'t another man who \\'ll treat her as white as her own brother did . Go on . Let her have her clothes . All right . Get \\' em , and get out . Hey , Dot . Hey . - Where you goin \\' ? - With the kid , you big bully . You called her a tramp , did n\\'t ya ? Just because she stayed out until 4:00 in the morning and you suspect where she was . Well , I stayed out until 4:00 in the morning , and you knew where I was . So I got a pretty good idea what you think of me . I \\'ll see you in the cemetery . Go on , Dot . Wake up , Dotty . Wake up . Hello , Floyd . Ma just hollered across the air shaft ... and said that she was makin \\' breakfast for a new bride . Are you a new bride ? Yes , darling . I \\'m going to be today . - What \\'s an old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Run along and play now . Aw , I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . You get out of here . I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . And at his age . - What time is it ? - Almost 11:00 . - I phoned the store and said we were both sick . - Has Eddie come yet ? - Nope . - He has n\\'t ? - Not yet . - I wonder why he does n\\'t come . - Maybe it \\'s \\' cause he does n\\'t know I \\'m here . - That \\'d be a good reason . He certainly would n\\'t come to see me . Oh , he does n\\'t really dislike you , Edna . No , not dislike . He hates me . And it is n\\'t just an average , everyday , amateur kind of hatred either . I \\'ll bet that guy spends hours practicing hating me . Aw , that \\'s just his way . You know , he \\'s kind of funny . That would be great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gee , Edna , it was swell the way you came through for me last night . - I \\'m awful grateful to ya . - And I \\'m grateful toJim . - He saved my life . - How ? Just suppose he did n\\'t turn out to be a heel last night . I \\'d have been married to him in three months , and after being nicely cemented ... with a wedding ring , the church service and everything ... I \\'d have found out what he really is . Yes , sir . He saved my life- \\' cause they send you to the chair these days for killing your husband . In the name of goodness , what are you doing ? - I \\'m trying something , but it wo n\\'t work . - What wo n\\'t ? I put some black ink in the white milk ... and the white milk turned black . But when I put the white milk in the black ink , the black wo n\\'t turn white . Put that ink away and clean up that mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what time Is It now ? It \\'s a little after 11:00 . - Where \\'d you put my stockings ? - Why , I put \\' em , uh-Is this Mrs . Cook \\'s boardinghouse ? Well , is Mr . Collins there ? Collins . Eddie Collins . He what ?

Schuyler 4-6583 . Schuyler 4-6583 . And hurry it up , deary . There \\'s a fire . Here . Hello ? Hello , Lathrop Radio Shop ? Well , can I speak to Mr . Collins , please ? Eddie Collins . Never mind the wisecracks . He \\'s there , I wan na speak to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Fresh guy trying to flirt with me . He what ? He was fired ? What for ? He said he was fired for robbin \\' the cash register . Well , you \\'re all right then . If he \\'s lost his job , it \\'s a cinch he \\'ll be here to marry ya . I ca n\\'t tell whether the fella was kiddin \\' or not . There he is now . See ? All of your troubles for nothing . Oh , gee , and I \\'m not dressed or anything . Oh , give me those stockings . I do n\\'t wan na subscribe to any magazines . I do n\\'t care if you \\'re working your way through the penitentiary . - Was that him , Edna ? - No . A book agent . Oh . What am I gon na do ? Now , stop worrying . If Eddie is only half the guy I think he is , he wo n\\'t let you down . That \\'s the trouble with us women . If we \\'d only realize that-Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I \\'m cookin \\' it for ya . - A whole pound of butter . I told you a piece of butter , not a pound of butter . A pound \\'s a piece . I \\'ll go , Edna . Oh , darling , you \\'re driving me crazy . Get out into the hall . You \\'ve done all the damage in here that you can . See if you can ruin the wallpaper . - Shall I do it with a knife ? - Get out of here ! - Was n\\'t him , huh ? - No . A man selling-For goodness \\' sake , take that long face off . This is your wedding day , not your funeral . He \\'ll be here . There \\'s a mistake somewhere . That \\'s all . Yeah , last night- that was the mistake . Do n\\'t be silly . He \\'ll be here . Oh , but I love him so much . Well , you can still love him and have a cup of coffee in your stomach too . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything again . - Fine . Then have a glass of milk . - I do n\\'t want any milk . Oh , come on . Have a glass of milk . It \\'ll do you good . You know , the first thing that you have to learn is-I \\'m getting hysterical . Open the door , Floyd . And if it \\'s a man selling coffins , tell him we \\'ll take two . Who \\'s dead ? Oh , Eddie ! - What \\'s the matter ? - Nothing . Say , listen . You \\'re going to be a married man . The first thing you have to learn is to get accustomed to your wife \\'s tears . I was over to your house , and they said you was n\\'t there . So I took a chance and come here . I called up your house , and your landlady said that you \\'d moved . I got a bigger room across the street . My landlady was sore . That \\'s why she would n\\'t tell you where I went . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing . They were kidding \\' ya . Oh , Eddie , I \\'m so happy . - Okay . - Now maybe you can eat some breakfast . We \\'ll eat downtown . We got ta get goin \\' . Go get your things .

When you get out of the train , you walk straight ahead and turn to the right . There are two exits there . You take the one to the left . Understand ? - Yeah . - Then when you get up on the street ... - you walk straight ahead-- I \\'m gon na take a cab . I \\'ll tell you which cab to take . Hey . Whose wedding is this , yours or mine ? Oh , Edna \\'s just trying to help us , Eddie . You was n\\'t on the other side when they had the war , were ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wondering how they ever got along without you . I phoned my orders over . Wo n\\'t you come down and see us get married ? No . I hate those things- deaths and funerals and things like that . Oh , gee , Edna . I can never thank you enough for all you \\'ve done for me . Oh , that \\'s all right , kid . I only hope you \\'re gon na be awful happy . If she ai n\\'t , you \\'ll hear from me , you big stiff . Okay . - Good luck . - So long . Good-bye . Oh , darling ! Night , now . - Hello , darling . - Hello . - What \\'s this ? - Oh . Just a couple of hunks of candy . Oh , gee , Eddie . - You know why ? - Sure . Because you love me , do n\\'t ya ?

Aw , gee , it was sweet of you to bring me the candy . And I got news for ya . I found a store . The boss is gon na lend me a hundred bucks ... and with the 650 I got saved up , I can swing the deal . He \\'ll let me have all the radios I want on time . - What do you know about that , huh ? - That \\'ll be swell . Of course , we may have to pinch nickels for a while but ... in the end , it \\'ll all be jake . - Gee whiz , I \\'m a happy guy . - Are you , Eddie ? Yeah . I been thinkin \\' about having my own store for over two years now . And while I ai n\\'t much on tossing \\' this baloney ... and all that mush stuff ... a guy could have a worse wife than you . - Ya little squirt . - Oh , Eddie . - I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hat and coat on , and I \\'ll take you over and show you the place . - Oh , I ca n\\'t now . - Why not ?

She phoned she \\'ll be up in a little while . - Ah , what does she want ? - Well , I wanted to ask her advice about something . - About what ? - About-Well , about the store , see what she thinks of it . Oh , gee . It \\'ll be tough if she do n\\'t like it . Oh , Eddie , that \\'s not a nice thing to say . Here she is . Now , please do n\\'t be mean to her . Come in . - Hello , Dot . - HI , Edna . How \\'s the grouch ? I thought they sent you down to Washington ... so you could tell the president how to run the country . Ooh . They sent the president up to see me . Oh , do n\\'t mind him , Edna . - He \\'s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks it . - He \\'s gon na open his own store soon . - Hmm ! I heard Wanamaker \\'s were going out of business . They probably figured the competition would be too much for \\' em . I \\'m going down to the corner and get a paper . Come on . Sit down . I \\'ve got so much to tell you . - Still in love with him ? - Oh , I \\'m just crazy about him . Edna , I \\'m going to have a baby . Oh , Dot . - I \\'m afraid . - Oh , do n\\'t be silly . - My mother had eight of_\\'em . - Yeah . My mother died having me . Yes , but things are different now . You know , the hospitals are better , and the doctors and things . No girl minds it anymore . - What does Eddie say ? - He does n\\'t know . Well , why do n\\'t you tell him ? Well , his heart \\'s so set on having that store . It \\'ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n\\'t know what to do . Edna , I \\'m so worried . You know , if the store \\'s gon na make Eddie happy , I want him to have it . - Sure . - When I think of what happened to my mother-Unless I had everything of the best- you know , the best doctors and everything-- I \\'d be frightened . - You poor kid . Now listen . This fella you \\'re married to is all right . He \\'s 100 ? /o . I know what \\'s the matter with him . He \\'s one of those sensitive eggs . Of course , he may not like me , but what the heck . Napol ? on had a couple of enemies too . Now you tell Eddie tonight . And if I know anything about men ... he \\'ll be stopping strangers on the street tomorrow , bragging about it . - Do you really think so ? - Oh , sure . All men are alike . They puff themselves up . You \\'d think they \\'d done something . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - He will be . I do n\\'t know though . He \\'s always yelling about living in a tenement ... and what a sin it is to have children if you ca n\\'t afford to give \\' em everything . I do n\\'t think I read anything in the papers about him being born in the White House . He was awful poor . That \\'s why he thinks like that about it . Here he is . Do n\\'t say anything . - You still here ? - No . Dld you get your paper , Eddle ? I got down there , and I did n\\'t have any change . You can get one next week . They \\'ll have a dozen new murders for you by then . Here , let me fix that tie . - It looks like a unbent pretzel . - The tie is-You only wear it . Other people have to look at it . I do n\\'t know how you ever picked this jane out for a friend . - She \\'s the dizziest dame I ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddie . Look what I got ! Look what I got ! - Where \\'d you get all this stuff ? - Eddie give us 60 cents to buy it . Aw , he \\'s crazy . It was - Sixty-Oh , what did you wan na come up here for anyway ? Go on outside and play . Go on . Go on . Go on now . Get out of here . Thanks a lot , Eddie ! Gim me a slice of that cone down there . Poor kids . I found \\' em downstairs in that dark hallway tryin \\' to play games . They ai n\\'t got a chance in life . Eddie , did you give him the 60 cents ? Listen , I got better things to do with my money ... than throw it away on a lot of kids . Say , you \\'re a swell egg . What are you gon na sell in your radio store ? Never mind . The way you run people \\'s business for them ... if you start butting \\' in , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I \\'m going . - Remember now . Tell him . - Tell him what ? Oh , nothing , Eddie . She \\'s got a secret for ya . Oh , she \\'s got a secret for me , but you know it . Geez , you \\'re runnin \\' my house for me , too , I see . - Sure . Bye , darlin \\' . - See you tomorrow . - Bye , grouch . - So long , dizzy . - What \\'s the big secret ? - I do n\\'t know whether you \\'ll like it or not . Hey , listen , kid . I \\'m so happy about the store , I \\'d like anything . Oh . Well ? What is it ? Eddie , I \\'m going back to work . - Back to work ? - Yeah . Hey , listen . No wife of mine is goin \\' to work . - What \\'d be the harm ? - I \\'ll do all the work that \\'s to be done in this family . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well-Well , it gets kind of lonesome staying \\' here all day all alone . Ca n\\'t you go to picture shows and things ? You just said we \\'d have to pinch nickels . Yeah , but I did n\\'t mean we \\'d have to pinch \\' em that hard . - You do n\\'t like livin \\' in just one room . Is that it ? - Oh , it \\'s all right . But I wish we had a flat of our own or something-you know , our own furniture . Ca n\\'t you see , Eddie ? If I went to work , you could have your store just the same . And with the money I make , we could-Do you think I \\'d take money you worked for ? - Oh , it \\'d be all right . - Not with me , it would n\\'t . My idea of a husband is a guy that looks after his wife and takes care of her ... and sees that she do n\\'t want for nothin \\' . If I ca n\\'t do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money- you work all day- or let you use it for something that I ought to be payin \\' for . Listen . They got a name for guys like that . Oh , Eddie , I did n\\'t mean to make you sore . I ai n\\'t sore . But I ai n\\'t as happy as I was . You can lay that on a line . It was our 10 weeks anniversary . And I had the store all picked out and everything . And , say , when I come in here tonight , I was walkin \\' on air . This kinda crumbs it all up . Gee , I did n\\'t know you was n\\'t satisfied . Oh , Eddie , I am satisfied . It \\'s all right . Let \\'s not talk about it . - I \\'ll bet that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . - No , she did n\\'t . Let \\'s not say any more about it . You \\'re crazy to have the store , and it \\'ll make you happy . Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I \\'m the husband , and it \\'s my job to make you happy . If a husband ai n\\'t for that , he ai n\\'t for nothin \\' . Gee , I told the real estate guy I \\'d meet him tonight . I ca n\\'t make up my mind about that sign . \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" or \\' \\' Edward Collins \" ? Course , \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" is all right for a saloon or somethin \\' like that . Nope , it ai n\\'t got class enough for a radio store . I \\'ll be back in 15 or 20 minutes . And I still think that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . I was afraid you was n\\'t comin \\' . What \\'s the idea of phoning \\' me to meet you here ? - Dot and me are movin \\' here . - You \\'re movin \\' here ? Sure . I got new furniture and everything . That \\'s why I asked you to come . I thought maybe you \\'d help me put \\' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anyway , so I figured out you might as well do it in the beginning . You \\'re moving here ? Yeah . Dot told me that secret . What \\'s that got to do with your moving and spending your money ? She wanted to go to work . - You mean that \\'s the secret she told you ? - Yeah . So I put two and two together and figured out why . She wanted a home with nice furnishings and things . - Say , how much did all this cost you ? - I shot the bankroll . - Oh , no . - Yeah . - All you \\'d saved ? - Sure . This is a swell joint . The furniture man is takin \\' charge . I bought everything new- from soup to nuts . When it \\'s finished , it \\'ll look just like a home that somebody \\'s lived in for a long time . Some surprise for the kid , huh ? Yeah , but what about your store ? Well , I figured , why let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up a business ? I might \\'ve made a flop of the store anyhow . Not that I would \\'ve . I \\'d have made a success of it . Do n\\'t get that idea in your nut . And you spent all your savings ? Sure . She \\'s worth it . She \\'s a great kid . You \\'ll have me crying in a minute , Eddie . What for ? You would n\\'t know . Come on . You never saw anything sweller than that parlor set I bought . Come on . Wait till you get a load of the bedroom . It \\'s got sheets and pillowcases and beds and everything in it . And the kitchen- We got a lot of pots and pans . It \\'s gon na be like a party . See , I \\'m gon na tell Dot that Pat and Sue have got a new flat ... and are havin \\' a housewarming and we \\'re invited . I asked a lot of the gang , and they \\'re in on it too . It \\'s gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . And the big payoff comes when I say ... \\' \\' Well , kid , how do you like your new home ? \" What do you think of the idea ? - I do n\\'t know . - You did n\\'t think it up . That \\'s why . Hey , wait a minute . Do n\\'t put that great big chair over there by the divan . - That \\'s where the chair belongs . - No , it is n\\'t . It belongs over on this side . Have n\\'t you got any sense of balance ? - You would get your mouth in it some way or another . dd Hey , hey . Wait until they get here . Aw , have a heart . I have n\\'t had any supper . And do n\\'t drink up all the punch . Here they are . Listen , Pat . Remember , this is supposed to be your home . You \\'re the host . - Right . I \\'ll take off my coat and collar . - That ai n\\'t funny . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Go on . I did n\\'t even know that Pat had moved from 92nd Street . Sure . They got a swell place here . - Hello , Dot . How are you ? - Hello , Sue . - Hello , Eddie . - I did n\\'t know that you \\'d moved . Oh , I \\'ve been here a week . Come in . Hi , everybody . - Hello , Chad . How are you ? - Hello , Dot . - Hello , Pat . How are you ? - Let me take your coat . - Have a schnapps . - Oh , no , thanks . Oh , gee , Sue , this is swell . Pat must have murdered a millionaire or something . Hey , you ai n\\'t seen nothin \\' yet . Come on out here and I \\'ll show you the kitchen . You \\'d think this was his house . Come on . Let \\'s eat . A closet , and it \\'s got glass in it too . And a sink and a washtub . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you keep your salt and pepper and spices and things . In the one marked \\' \\' Salt , \" you keep the salt . In the one marked \\' \\' Pepper , \" you keep the pepper . Gee , Eddie , ai n\\'t it swell ? Look at that darling table . The guy said it was the breakfast nook . Oh , Eddie , you think we \\'ll ever have a place like this ? - Would you like to live here , kid ? - Oh , gee , would I ? - Of course , we could n\\'t afford-- Why not ? Well , we could n\\'t afford the money now . Well , why now ? - Well , you wan na get your store first . - Yeah . Oh , yeah . That \\'s right . Say , wait till you get a load of the bedroom . Come on ! Say , if Eddie can get Dot a home like this , why ca n\\'t you get me one ? I thought that \\'d crop up . - Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid . There \\'s a bed . You ca n\\'t buy a better bed than that- 65 bucks . - But how did you-- Oh , Pat told me . Come on . Feel it . Just feel it . Ai n\\'t this a bed ? Not like that old egg crate we sleep in . I \\'ve never seen you so enthusiastic . The house has sure made a hit with you . Come on . Now I \\'m gon na show you somethin \\' . Just grand . There \\'s the bridges over there . And there \\'s all New York to pick from . Ai n\\'t the lights great ? And the East River . And stars . Are n\\'t they beautiful ? Not phony one\\'s either . Gee , a roof like this would be a swell place for ... kids to play . Would n\\'t it , Eddie ? You know , they could get plenty of fresh air ... and their mothers would n\\'t have to worry about streetcars ... and taxis and trucks and things . You know , rich kids could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , do n\\'t you , kid ? Oh , I think it \\'s just grand . I \\'m awful glad for Pat and Sue . Okay . We better get back to the bunch now . You said it . Sue , it \\'s the grandest flat I ever saw . - I \\'m awfully glad you like it , Dot . - Oh , it \\'s sweet for anything . Dot , sit down . Here goes . Well , kid , it \\'s yours . - Mine ? What do you mean , mine ? - Sure . Yours . This is where you \\'re gon na live . I bought it for you . - You bought it for me ? - Sure . You know that secret about goin \\' back to work ? Well , I doped it out that you was n\\'t satisfied where you \\'re livin \\' . So this is the answer . - Well , what about your store ? - Thls Is It . You spent all your money for this ? I shot the works . - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t owe a nickel on It . Well , what do ya say ? I do n\\'t know . Do n\\'t seem to make such a hit with ya now . Naturally , Eddie . She \\'s surprised . You ca n\\'t get a thing like this through your head in a minute . - Did you know he was doing it , Edna ? - Yeah , I helped him fi ? x It up . Why \\'d you let him spend all the money ? Well , folks , it looks like a bust . Oh , no , it is n\\'t , Eddie . I think it \\'s just great . I \\'m tickled to death . - You \\'re the swellest husband any girl ever had . - Okay . Dot \\'s only disappointed for you , Eddie . She was so anxious for you to have the store ... she did n\\'t want you to spend the money for anything else . - That \\'s right . - Sure . That \\'s why , dear . You know I think it \\'s just swell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long time dead . Live while ya can . That \\'s what I say . When I think of the way my folks used to live . They did n\\'t have enough money to support themselves ... so they go and have nine kids . My old lady used to scrub floors in an office building . 4:00 every morning she went to work- sick or well , summer or winter . I can see her goin\\'out when It was 20 below zero ... with a cough that \\'d tear the heart out of ya . And for what ? To bring up a couple ofklds and die- dle before they was ever any comfort to her . Not for Dot . Every nickel I make , she and I are gon na spend on ourselves . - My sister died bringing up-- Oh , stop it ! Ca n\\'t you stop it ! You \\'d think there was nothin \\' else in the world to talk about . All right . There , there , dear . Shh . What \\'s wrong ? Dot \\'s going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddle . No , she \\'s just a little hysterical . That \\'s all . We should n\\'t have talked about those things . - That \\'s right . I guess we shouldn\\'t . - Sue told me , but I forgot . Gee , everybody in New York seems to know about it ... but the only guy that \\'s interested . Oh , gee , Eddie , I wish you \\'d let me do that . Do n\\'t be crazy , will ya ? You \\'re goin \\' to the hospital in a few weeks . You know the doc told you not to do any hard work . I do n\\'t think he knows what he \\'s talkin \\' about . I do n\\'t like him . - You want me to get you a different one ? - No . If you ca n\\'t get the best , he \\'s as good as any of the others , I guess . He \\'s all right . I worry . That \\'s all . - About what ? - About everything . You having to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pinching \\' every nickel the way you have . I do n\\'t want a baby any more than you do . All right , all right . Now you told me that a thousand times . Let \\'s not talk about it . Is there any other doctor you got in mind ? There was somethin \\' in the paper about a society woman . The doctor \\'s name was Burgess . His picture was there . Gee , he was awful kind-lookin \\' . Not that we could get him . He \\'s only for millionaires . As long as you ca n\\'t get him , you might as well pick out the best . Whoo-ooh ! Dot ! Now do n\\'t bring her in here . I do n\\'t want her razzin \\' me . - Good morning . - Hello , Edna . - Hello , Eddie . - So long . Floyd made such a racket , I did n\\'t wait for breakfast . - Got a cup of coffee ? - Sure . Hmm . You got a new washerwoman , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t got enough bluing in this water . I knew somethin \\' would be wrong with it when you seen it . - Here . - Thanks . Got a cigarette ? No , I cut \\' em out . They was puttin \\' my throat on the bum . Come on , Edna . Drink this in the other room . Yeah , go on . Beat it , will ya ? You give me the willies . That \\'s good . - How do you feel ? - Oh , all right . - How do you feel when you feel bad ? - I worry . Yeah , and you worry other people too . You worry him . Your child \\'ll probably grow up to be a radio broadcaster . Gee , It \\'s 10 minutes to 8 . ? 00 . I got ta blow . Do n\\'t touch those things . I \\'ll finish \\' em when I come home . - Good-bye , darling . - So long . - So long , meddlesome . - Good-bye , grouch . Break a leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so miserable . - What ? - He \\'s so square about everything . Says smoking hurts his throat . He cut it out so he could save the money . It does n\\'t seem fair that he should give up all his fun just because of me . Yeah , it \\'s tough on husbands . Nobody knows what a husband suffers when his wife has a baby ... and a big juicy raspberry . It must be great for a woman when everything is right- you know , when she can afford a doctor like that man Burgess ... and when she knows her husband wants the baby . You want it , do n\\'t you , Dot ? I \\'m crazy about it . That is , I would be ... if it were n\\'t for Eddie and if I was n\\'t afraid . - How do you know he does n\\'t want it ? - The things he says . I can feel it , too , in the way he acts . He does n\\'t like children . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? - Only seven months . Of course , all parents are proud of their children . But honestly , even if this was somebody else \\'s kid ... I \\'d have to admit it \\'s the cleverest youngster I ever saw . - Do n\\'t you think so , Mama ? - I honestly do . Hey , lookit ! The little son of a gun \\'s got ahold of my finger . That \\'s what I mean . Is n\\'t that clever ? - She \\'s a darling . Look at her . - Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Hey , Eddie . Eddie . Eddie . - Has Mr . Randall \\'s set been fixed for him ? - Yes , sir . - Gee , that \\'s a great kid you got . - We think so . - Say , Mr . Lathrop ? - Yes ? Do you think that a woman havin \\' a baby ... you know , that she has n\\'t always wanted ... could-could learn to love it ... you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your wife , eh ? She \\'s afraid . Say , there ai n\\'t any danger in these things , is there ? Well , lots of women manage to have babies ... without calling out the militia . There \\'s no danger when they have the proper attention . She should be made to have confidence in her doctor . That \\'s just it . My wife ai n\\'t got any . That \\'s not right . - She speaks of a Dr . Burgess . - Burgess ? You \\'d have to be a millionaire to have him . - Goin \\' to lunch , Eddie ? - Nah , I cut lunches out . I was gettin \\' too fat . - This Dr . Burgess is good , huh ? - And expensive . When a king is born , they send for him . I wonder how you could get in to see a guy like that . - Mr . Lathrop , will you take a look at this set , please ? - Oh , yes . Certainly . Hey , Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club ? - Yeah . Do you suppose he could get me on in one of them preliminary fights ? Say , some of those boys are pretty good . - What do you wan na take a beatin \\' for ? - Ten bucks a round . Four rounds- 40 bucks . I can use that dough swell . - I can fix it for ya , but I think you \\'re nutty . - Okay . 7:00 . Say , ai n\\'t that job of yours got any hours ? A guy wanted his radio fixed , so I did it on the side . I should think you \\'d try gettin \\' home ... with your wife goin \\' to the hospital and everything . - How is she ? - She \\'s worrying herself sick . That \\'s how she is . But , gee , she ought n\\'t to do that . I do n\\'t think she knows that . You ought to tell her . - You had any supper ? - I ai n\\'t hungry . Gettin \\' your beauty sleep , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hurt you to hang around once in a while . Okay . That \\' \\' okay \" does me a lot of good , do n\\'t it ? Gee , kid , you know I \\'m for you , do n\\'t ya ? Well , it do n\\'t look like it . You have n\\'t spent an evening in the house for two weeks now . I do n\\'t mean to be a grouch , Eddie , but ... I \\'m frightened . Is it the doctor ? Is that what makes you afraid ? Oh , he \\'s all right , I guess . It \\'s my fault . You know , you have confidence in some people , and others you have n\\'t . There \\'s no reason . You just have . That \\'s all . Sure , I know how it is , kid . Eddie , you \\'re gon na stick around and go to the hospital with me tonight , ai n\\'t ya ? You betcha . No . Wait a minute . - I tell ya , I got ta go out-- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Oh , no . Just for a half an hour , kid . - Ca n\\'t even stay with me tonight . I \\'ll be right back . Honest I will . Mmm . Your honey is searching among the \\' \\' bees . \" Hello ? Yeah , this is his secretary . Mm-hmm . Who wants to talk to him ? Joe ? - There \\'s a Joe wants to talk to you . - Hello , Joe . Tonight ? Sure I \\'ll be there . Hey , that \\'s great . It comes just at the right time . Thanks . So long . I \\'ll be a little longer now , but I \\'ll be back at 9:00 . I got another fella to see now . - You pick a swell night to make a date . - You sure do . This ai n\\'t a date . Honest it ain\\'t . - I \\'ll be back as quick as I can . - Give my love toJenny , will ya ? - WhatJenny ? - WhateverJenny happens to be there . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . But I \\'m sure the doctor you have is competent . It ai n\\'t that . You see , she \\'s just a kid herself , and she \\'s frightened . Her mother died that way . She read about you In the paper , Dr . Burgess . Well , of course , we never thought we could get ya . She was sayin\\'that It would be swell ... If she could get a guy like you to be with her . Did you tell her you were coming to see me ? No , sir . She and me ai n\\'t been gettin \\' along very well lately . I \\'ve been workin \\' nights . I did n\\'t tell her about it . She thinks I \\'ve been chiseling \\' on her , I guess . I ca n\\'t tell things like that . I \\'m kind of a mug that way . Of course , I could n\\'t pay you what you \\'re worth . But I tell ya . I make 45 bucks a week , and pick up 15 workin \\' nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight tonight . And I got 381 saved up , see ? - Are you a prizefighter ? - No , sir . But a friend of mine \\'s gettin \\' me on ... in the preliminaries over at the Empire Club . I get 10 bucks a round , and I do n\\'t mind takin \\' a beating for 40 bucks . Llsten , Dr . Burgess-I always been kinda proud , see ? You know , pay my own way , take nothin \\' from nobody . But I ai n\\'t that way now , Doc . I \\'m beggin \\' you . If she knew she was gon na have you with her ... everything would be all right . But as it is ... she \\'s so sick from worry-I \\'m afraid maybe she \\'ll die . Will you do it , Doc ? I \\'ll give you the $381 I got saved up ... and I \\'ll pay you back dollar for dollar . Please do it , will ya , Doc ? So help me , God , I\\'ll- I \\'ll lay down my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . - I guess I \\'m kinda nervous about this child thing . - Mm-hmm . Kinda goofy , huh ? Gee , Doc , I \\'m sorry I have n\\'t got a cigar or somethin \\' to offer ya . I cut out smokin \\' . It was hurtin \\' my throat . This is a swell dump you got here . Oh , I did n\\'t mean-Okay . Flght ! - He said 9:00 . - Do n\\'t worry . You \\'d think the least he could do would be to be with me tonight . Now , now , now . Do n\\'t get yourself all worked up . One , two-Get out . Get out . Hey , Mike , knock that fella out , will ya ? This ai n\\'t a slaughterhouse . I wanted to give him a break , but I \\'ll put him away right at the next gong . Aw , why do n\\'t ya quit ? I know what I \\'m doin \\' . I would n\\'t take a beatin \\' like that for a hundred bucks . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . One , two , three , four ... five , six ... seven , eight , nine-Uh ! Do n\\'t knock me out , will ya , buddy ? I need the cash . - My wife \\'s gon na have a kid . - Well , why did n\\'t you tell me ? I guess I ca n\\'t make it though . Hold on to me . Take a deep breath . Break it up . Thanks . Good-bye . I \\'ve arranged for the hospital . The cab will be here at 11:00 . I never thought Eddie would do this to me . But , darling , he \\'s only an hour late . Some hours are lifetimes . He \\'s walked out on me . - When \\'s the kid expected ? - Any-Anytime now . - I got two of them . - Yeah ? How long before they get to know ya ? Mine knew me inside of two months . - But of course , mine was kinda extra bright . - Yeah . Oh , gee , kid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about you . - I could n\\'t help it . Could n\\'t spend a couple of minutes with me , tonight of all nights ? You know how nervous I am . But you could go to some speakeasy with a bunch of fellas ... and get your face all battered up in a drunken brawl . Is that what ya think ? That \\'s what it looks like to me . Okay . Do you want me to go with ya ? You do n\\'t have to bother about me anymore at all , Eddie . I got Burgess for ya ! - How about it , Doctor ? - Congratulations . Twins . - Twins ? - Twins . - Boys or girls ? - Both . - Twins ! - Yes , sir . The baby business is picking up . Sometimes I was here , and I was the only one . - This your first ? - Yes , and my last . I would n\\'t go through this again for all the money in the world . How many kids have you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t know . You do n\\'t know ? I know I got six . What \\'s happening upstairs , I ca n\\'t tell ya . Here I am . You \\'re the father of a fine baby girl , Mr . Vernon . - Oh , well . - Oh ! - Put him over here on the-- It was too much for him . - He \\'ll be all right . - What \\'s the matter with him ? - I \\'ve got some smelling salts . - That \\'s fine . Give him some . - He \\'ll be all right . - He \\'s as white as a sheet . He \\'ll be all right in a minute . People kid about fathers , but they do n\\'t realize ... what a guy has to go through when his wife has a baby . If he had as many as I got , he \\'d stay unconscious . He \\'s coming to now . He \\'s fine . - What happened ? - You just had a baby . I would n\\'t go through this again for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or he \\'ll faint again . - It \\'s all right , Mr . Vernon . You come with me . - Hold him up . - Gee , I \\'m gettin \\' nervous myself now . Do n\\'t be nervous . Say , Mr . Linsky , I wan na ask you a question . My wife was n\\'t any too anxious to- to have this kid . Say , in two weeks , she will be crazy about it . - Is that straight ? - They always are . Be careful . Do n\\'t let her think that you are more concerned for the baby ... than what you are for her . Women get jealous under those conditions . You know , be interested , but not anxious . After all , you \\'ve known your wife for years ... and the baby is practically a stranger . Yeah , that \\'s right . Excuse me . I got ta phone my partner . Mr . Collins ? - Yeah ? - A boy . Okay . Your wife will see you in just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know about that ? My kid \\'s 22 hours old already . They get old very quickly when they \\'re young . - Hello , Doctor .

Edward Collins \\'s son- $50 . \" What does that mean ? He \\'s giving your boy $50 to start a bank account . And he would n\\'t let me give him anything . Gee . That \\'s a guy for ya , ai n\\'t it ? Oh , they \\'re just grand , Mrs . Linsky . Every time I have a baby , my husband gives me a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t have any more room . - What do you think of it ? - Oh . Oh , no , this is n\\'t yours . This baby \\'s six days old . She acts like she hates the child . I guess maybe she did n\\'t want it . Do parents hate children they do n\\'t want ? I heard of people like that . How do you like this one ? - Oh , it \\'s darling . - Oh , no . This is young Mussolini . dd Gee , it \\'s funny when you think of it , ai n\\'t it ? Everybody in the world was once just a little bundle like that . - Is n\\'t this one cute ? - Oh , it \\'s lovely . Just look at those little hands . Did you ever see such an adorable nose ? Gee , it \\'s swell . Do n\\'t you want to hold your baby ? Is this mine ? - Honest ? Oh . - Thls Is It . I would n\\'t cry over It , Mrs . Colllns . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ?

Okay . - Is that it ? - Yes , that \\'s it , and it \\'s no \\' \\' it . \" Well , I did n\\'t mean it that way . Let \\'s not talk about it . - That suits me too , kid . - I thought it would . We \\'ll take him back to the nursery now . I asked Dr . Burgess how we happened to get a fine doctor like him . He just laughed and said that you \\'d tell me . Oh , my boss knew him . He did it for him . - He give me a check for the baby \\'s bank too . - He did ? - Was n\\'t that swell of him ? - Yeah . Those big guys do a lot of work for charity . So you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-Well - Gee , everything I say seems to be wrong . Oh , Eddie . I \\'d give anything if- well , if things were different . Aw , everything \\'s gon na be all right , kid . We ai n\\'t gon na stop living just because we got a baby . You and me is gon na have a good time , the same as always . Why , In six months we \\'ll have forgotten we got a kid . Please go now . I \\'m tired . Sure . - When \\'ll you be home ? - In about two weeks . Well , hurry it up . I \\'ll feel like stepping \\' out a bit . - So long , kid . - So long . I \\'ll be back every day . Oh , Mrs . Linsky , she \\'s getting bigger every day . What are you going to call her ? I \\'m calling her Shelly , after my mother-in-law . Her name was Esther , but it \\'s close enough . Well , how are all the mothers today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the cab downstairs ? - Yes . Are you ready ? Mm-hmm . - Are you leaving now ? - Yes . But I heard you tell your husband that you were going tomorrow . - I want to surprise him . - Oh . Say , listen , kid . - Have you thought this thing over ? - Yep . I could n\\'t live with a man that did n\\'t like his own child . All he thinks about is stepping out . I could n\\'t go back to Eddie for anything . I \\'d get to hate him . Well , it \\'s your funeral , kid . Well , what are you going to do with that ? Well , I thought maybe the kid would like to fool around with it . What ? A two-weeks-old baby ? Well , it \\'s only a little balloon . The doctor \\'s in the ward . You \\'ll have to wait a few minutes . - Dr . Gibson ? - Yes ? Just a minute , please . - Hurry , Nurse Parson . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My baby . Something \\'s happened to my baby !

I want my baby ! I want my baby ! - I want my baby ! - What \\'s the matter , kid ? - Something \\'s happened to my baby . - Where ? In there ! It \\'s not your baby . There \\'s no danger . Your husband will get it . Now , everything is all right . - It \\'s all right . - He \\'s all right , kid . Look . Here he is . - He \\'s all right . - It was Mrs . Burns \\'s baby .

    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "SEN. WHITEHOUSE SHARES WESTERLY GIRL'S STORY IN PUSH FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH\n",
      "  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  \n",
      "   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. \n",

Next, we can remove some 'stop words', stem the remaining words to remove suffixes, prefixes and (in some languages) infixes, or lemmatize tokens by intelligently grouping inflected or variant forms of the same word (e.g., with a stemmer and a dictionary). \n",

Lemmatization can be thought of as finding the root or the base of the word after removing inflections and other variations of words. Another possible way of finding the roots of words is using NLTK's porting or stemming functionalities, but we will not be getting into them.\n",

The [`ConditionalFreqDist`](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#nltk.probability.ConditionalProbDist) class reads in an iterable of tuples, the first element is the condition and the second the focal word. For starters, we will use word lengths as the conditions, but tags or clusters will provide more useful results."

       "\"@@1000 * Retired Detective * Former Police officer Hercule Poirot ( ; ) is a fictional Belgian detective , created by Agatha Christie . Poirot is one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters , appearing in 33 novels , one play ( ' ' Black Coffee ' ' ) , and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975 . Poirot has been portrayed on radio , on screen , for films and television , by various actors , including John Moffatt , Albert Finney , Sir Peter Ustinov , Sir Ian Holm , Tony Randall , Alfred Molina , and David Suchet. # Overview # # Influences # Poirot's name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time : Marie Belloc Lowndes ' Hercule Popeau and Frank Howel Evans ' Monsieur Poiret , a retired Belgian police officer living in London . A more obvious influence on the early Poirot stories is that of Arthur Conan Doyle . In ' ' An Autobiography ' ' Christie admits , I was still writing in the Sherlock Holmes tradition eccentric detective , stooge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japp . For his part , Conan Doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin and his anonymous narrator , and basing his character Sherlock Holmes on Joseph Bell , who in his use of ratiocination prefigured Poirot's reliance on his little grey cells . Poirot also bears a striking resemblance to A. E. W. Mason's fictional detective , Inspector Hanaud of the French Sret , who first appeared in the 1910 novel ' ' At the Villa Rose ' ' and predates the first Poirot novel by ten years . Poirot was a francophone . Unlike the models mentioned above , Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book , written in 1916 and published in 1920 . Not only was his Belgian nationality interesting because of Belgium's occupation by Germany ( which provided a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective would be out of work and available to solve mysteries at an English country house ) . At the time of Christie's writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the invasion of their country had constituted Britain's ' ' casus belli ' ' for entering World War I , and British wartime propaganda emphasised the Rape of Belgium . # Popularity # Poirot first appeared in ' ' The Mysterious Affair at Styles ' ' ( published in 1920 ) and exited in ' ' Curtain ' ' ( published in 1975 ) . Following the latter , Poirot was the only fictional character to receive an obituary on the front page of ' ' The New York Times ' ' . By 1930 , Agatha Christie found Poirot insufferable , and by 1960 she felt that he was a detestable , bombastic , tiresome , ego-centric little creep . Yet the public loved him and Christie refused to kill him off , claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked . # Appearance and propinquities # Captain Arthur Hastings ' first description of Poirot : # He was hardly more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity . His head was exactly the shape of an egg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His moustache was very stiff and military . Even if everything on his face was covered , the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible . # # The neatness of his attire was almost incredible ; I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound . Yet this quaint dandified little man who , I was sorry to see , now limped badly , had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police . # Agatha Christie's initial description of Poirot in ' ' The Murder on the Orient Express ' ' : # By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young French lieutenant , resplendent in uniform , conversing with a small man ( Hercule Poirot ) muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache . # In the later books , his limp is not mentioned , suggesting it may have been a temporary wartime injury . Poirot has green eyes that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is struck by a clever idea , and dark hair , which he dyes later in life . However , many of his screen incarnations are portrayed as bald or balding . Frequent mention is made of his patent-leather shoes , damage to which is frequently a source of misery for him , but comical for the reader . Poirot's appearance , regarded as fastidious during his early career , later falls hopelessly out of fashion . He employs pince-nez reading glasses . Among Poirot's most significant personal attributes is the sensitivity of his stomach : # The plane dropped slightly . ' ' Mon estomac ' ' , thought Hercule Poirot , and closed his eyes determinedly . # He suffers from sea sickness , and in ' ' Death in the Clouds ' ' he states that his air sickness prevents him from being more alert at the time of the murder . Later in his life , we are told : # Always a man who had taken his stomach seriously , he was reaping his reward in old age . Eating was not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Poirot is extremely punctual and carries a turnip pocket watch almost to the end of his career . A brief passage in ' ' The Big Four ' ' provides information about Poirot's birth or at least childhood in or near the town of Spa , Belgium or in the village of Ellezelles ( province of Hainaut , Belgium a few memorials dedicated to Hercule Poirot can be seen in the center of this village ) : But we did not go into Spa itself . We left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills , till we reached a little hamlet and an isolated white villa high on the hillside . Christie strongly implies that this quiet retreat in the Ardennes near Spa is the location of the Poirot family home . Christie is purposefully vague , as Poirot is thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels . And in ' ' An Autobiography , ' ' she admitted that she already imagined him to be an old man in 1920 . At the time , however , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades to come . Christie wrote that Poirot is a Roman Catholic , and gave her character a strong sense of Catholic morality in later works . Christie provides little information regarding Poirots childhood , only mentioning in ' ' Three Act Tragedy ' ' that he comes from a large family with little wealth . # Policeman # # Gustave ... was not a policeman . I have dealt with policemen all my life and I ' ' know ' ' . He could pass as a detective to an outsider but not to a man who was a policeman himself . : Hercule Poirot # Hercule Poirot had joined the Brussels police force by 1893 . Very little mention is made about this part of his life , but in The Nemean Lion ( 1939 ) Poirot refers to a Belgian case of his in which a wealthy soap manufacturer ... poisoned his wife in order to be free to marry his secretary . As Poirot was often misleading about his past to gain information , the truthfulness of that statement is unknown . Inspector Japp offers some insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a colleague : # You've heard me speak of Mr Poirot ? It was in 1904 he and I worked together the Abercrombie forgery case you remember he was run down in Brussels . Ah , those were the days Moosier . Then , do you remember Baron Altara ? There was a pretty rogue for you ! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe . But we nailed him in Antwerp thanks to Mr. Poirot here . # In the short story ' ' The Chocolate Box ' ' ( 1923 ) Poirot reveals to Captain Arthur Hastings an account of what he considers to be his only failure . Poirot admits that he has failed to solve a crime innumerable times : # I have been called in too late . Very often another , working towards the same goal , has arrived there first . Twice I have been struck down with illness just as I was on the point of success . # Nevertheless , he regards the 1893 case in The Chocolate Box , as his only actual failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrator of his personal history and there is no evidence that Christie sketched it out in any depth . During his police career Poirot shot a man who was firing from a roof into the public below . In Lord Edgeware Dies , Poirot reveals that he learned to read writing upside down during his police career . Around that time he met Xavier Bouc , director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits . Poirot also became a uniformed director , working on trains . In ' ' The Double Clue , ' ' Poirot mentions that he was Chief of Police of Brussels , until the Great War ( WWI ) forced him to leave for England . # Private detective # # I had called in at my friend Poirot's rooms to find him sadly overworked . So much had he become the rage that every rich woman who had mislaid a bracelet or lost a pet kitten rushed to secure the services of the great Hercule Poirot . # During World War I , Poirot left Belgium for England as a refugee ( although he returned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met his lifelong friend , Captain Arthur Hastings and solved the first of his cases to be published : ' ' The Mysterious Affair at Styles ' ' . It is clear that Hastings and Poirot are already friends when they meet in Chapter 2 of the novel , as Hastings tells Cynthia that he has not seen him for some years . Particulars such as the date of 1916 for the case and that Hastings had met Poirot in Belgium , are given in ' ' Curtain : Poirot's Last Case ' ' , Chapter 1 ( someone had been shot in a village where Hastings was duck-shooting and Poirot had been called in from the Brussels police to investigate ) . After that case , Poirot apparently came to the attention of the British secret service and undertook cases for the British government , including foiling the attempted abduction of the Prime Minister . Readers were told that the British authorities had learned of Poirot's keen investigative ability from certain Belgian royals . After the war Poirot became a private detective and began undertaking civilian cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , 56B Whitehaven Mansions . Hastings first visits the house when he returns to England in June 1935 from Argentina in ' ' The A.B.C . Murders ' ' , Chapter 1 ( it is a plot point in the novel that the flat is at Whitehaven Mansions because a letter to Poirot is misaddressed ) . It was chosen by Poirot for its symmetry . ( This building was in fact built in 1936 , decades after Poirot fictionally moved in . ) His first case was The Affair at the Victory Ball , which allowed Poirot to enter high society and begin his career as a private detective . Between the world wars , Poirot travelled all over Europe , Africa , Asia , and half of South America investigating crimes and solving murders . Most of his cases occurred during this time and he was at the height of his powers at this point in his life . In ' ' The Murder on the Links ' ' , the Belgian pits his grey cells against a French murderer . In the Middle East , he solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' ' Murder in Mesopotamia ' ' with ease and even survived ' ' An Appointment with Death ' ' . As he passed through Eastern Europe on his return trip , he solved ' ' The Murder on the Orient Express ' ' . However he did not travel to North America , the West Indies , the Caribbean or Oceania , probably due to sea sickness . # It is this villainous sea that troubles me ! The ' ' mal de mer ' ' it is horrible suffering ! # It was during this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff , a glamorous jewel thief . The history of the Countess is , like Poirot's , steeped in mystery . She claims to have been a member of the Russian aristocracy before the Russian Rebellion and suffered greatly as a result , but how much of that story is true is an open question . Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life . Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice . # It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanker after large and flamboyant women . Poirot had never been able to rid himself of the fatal fascination that the Countess held for him . # Although letting the Countess escape was morally questionable , it was not uncommon . In ' ' The Nemean Lion ' ' , Poirot sided with the criminal , Miss Amy Carnaby , allowing her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins , who , Poirot discovered , had plans to commit murder . Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign . In ' ' The Murder of Roger Ackroyd ' ' , Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare the feelings of the murderer's relatives . In ' ' The Augean Stables ' ' , he helped the government to cover up vast corruption . In ' ' Murder on the Orient Express ' ' , Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in Ratchett's murder . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been acquitted in America over a technicality . Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted Ratchett and twelve people had stabbed him , Poirot produced an alternate sequence of events to explain the death . After his cases in the Middle East , Poirot returned to Britain . Apart from some of the so-called Labours of Hercules ( see next section ) he very rarely went abroad during his later career . While Poirot was usually paid handsomely by clients , he was also known to take on cases that piqued his curiosity , although they did not pay well . Poirot shows a love of steam trains , which Christie contrasts with Hasting's love of autos : this is shown in ' ' The Plymouth Express ' ' , ' ' The Mystery of the Blue Train ' ' , ' ' Murder on the Orient Express ' ' , and ' ' The ABC Murders ' ' ( in the TV series , steam trains are seen in nearly all of the episodes ) . # Retirement # # Thats the way of it . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prima Donnas farewell performance wont be in it with yours , Poirot . # Confusion surrounds Poirot's retirement . Most of the cases covered by Poirot's private detective agency take place before his retirement to grow marrows , at which time he solves ' ' The Murder of Roger Ackroyd ' ' . It has been said that the twelve cases related in ' ' The Labours of Hercules ' ' ( 1947 ) must refer to a different retirement , but the fact that Poirot specifically says that he intends to grow marrows indicates that these stories also take place before ' ' Roger Ackroyd ' ' , and presumably Poirot closed his agency once he had completed them . There is specific mention in The Capture of Cerberus of the twenty year gap between Poirot's previous meeting with Countess Rossakoff and this one . If the ' ' Labours ' ' precede the events in ' ' Roger Ackroyd ' ' , then the Ackroyd case must have taken place around twenty years ' ' later ' ' than it was published , and so must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative would be that having failed to grow marrows once , Poirot is determined to have another go , but this is specifically denied by Poirot himself . Also , in The Erymanthian Boar , a character is said to have been turned out of Austria by the Nazis , implying that the events of ' ' The Labours of Hercules ' ' took place after 1937 . Another alternative would be to suggest that the Preface to the ' ' Labours ' ' takes place at one date but that the labours are completed over a matter of twenty years . None of the explanations is especially attractive . In terms of a rudimentary chronology , Poirot speaks of retiring to grow marrows in Chapter 18 of ' ' The Big Four ' ' ( 1927 ) which places that novel out of published order before ' ' Roger Ackroyd ' ' . He declines to solve a case for the Home Secretary because he is retired in Chapter One of ' ' Peril at End House ' ' ( 1932 ) . He is certainly retired at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but he does not enjoy his retirement and repeatedly takes cases thereafter when his curiosity is engaged . He continues to employ his secretary , Miss Lemon , at the time of the cases retold in ' ' Hickory Dickory Dock ' ' and ' ' Dead Man's Folly ' ' , which take place in the mid-1950s . It is therefore better to assume that Christie provided no authoritative chronology for Poirot's retirement , but assumed that he could either be an active detective , a consulting detective , or a retired detective as the needs of the immediate case required . One consistent element about Poirot's retirement is that his fame declines during it , so that in the later novels he is often disappointed when characters ( especially younger characters ) recognise neither him nor his name : # I should , perhaps , Madame , tell you a little more about myself . I am ' ' Hercule Poirot ' ' . <br/> The revelation left Mrs Summerhayes unmoved . <br/> What a lovely name , she said kindly . Greek , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # He , I knew , was not likely to be far from his headquarters . The time when cases had drawn him from one end of England to the other was past . Hastings # Poirot is less active during the cases that take place at the end of his career . Beginning with ' ' Three Act Tragedy ' ' ( 1934 ) , Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a sub-genre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the periphery of events . In novels such as ' ' Taken at the Flood ' ' , ' ' After the Funeral ' ' , and ' ' Hickory Dickory Dock ' ' , he is even less in evidence , frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character . In ' ' Cat Among the Pigeons ' ' , Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought . Whether this was a reflection of his age or of Christie's distaste for him , is impossible to assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' ' Ordeal by Innocence ' ' ( 1957 ) , which could easily have been Poirot novels , represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of his presence in such works . Towards the end of his career , it becomes clear that Poirot's retirement is no longer a convenient fiction . He assumes a genuinely inactive lifestyle during which he concerns himself with studying famous unsolved cases of the past and reading detective novels . He even writes a book about mystery fiction in which he deals sternly with Edgar Allan Poe and Wilkie Collins . Poirot ( and , it is reasonable to suppose , his creator ) becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up-and-coming generation's young people . In ' ' Hickory Dickory Dock ' ' , he investigates the strange goings on in a student hostel , while in ' ' Third Girl ' ' ( 1966 ) he is forced into contact with the smart set of Chelsea youths . In the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties , he proves himself once again , but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigator , Mr. Goby ) who provide him with the clues that he can no longer gather for himself . # ' ' You're too old ' ' . Nobody told me you were so old . I really don't want to be rude but there it is . ' ' You're too old ' ' . I'm really very sorry . # Notably , during this time his physical characteristics also change dramatically , and by the time Arthur Hastings meets Poirot again in ' ' Curtain ' ' , he looks very different from his previous appearances , having become thin with age and with obviously dyed hair . # Death # Poirot passes away from complications of a heart condition at the end of ' ' Curtain : Poirot's Last Case ' ' . He had moved his amyl nitrite pills out of his reach , possibly because of guilt . He thereby became the murderer in ' ' Curtain ' ' , although it was for the benefit of others . Poirot himself noted that he wanted to kill his victim shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the arrogance of the murderer , concerned that he may come to view himself as entitled to kill those he deemed necessary to eliminate . The murderer he was hunting had never expressly killed anyone , but subtly and psychologically , he had manipulated others to kill for him , manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts as nothing more a momentary passion . Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself , as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted as he did not legally do anything wrong . It is revealed at the end of ' ' Curtain ' ' that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from arthritis , to give the impression that he is more infirm than he is . His last recorded words are ' ' Cher ami ! ' ' , spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room . Poirot was buried at Styles , and his funeral was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judith . Hastings reasoned , Here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country . He was to lie here at the last . While Poirot's actual death and funeral occurred in ' ' Curtain ' ' , years after his retirement from active investigation , it was not the first time Hastings attended the funeral of his best friend . In ' ' The Big Four ' ' ( 1927 ) Poirot feigned his death and subsequent funeral to launch a surprise attack on the Big Four . # Recurring characters # # Arthur Hastings # Hastings , a former British Army officer , first meets Poirot during Poirot's years as a police officer in Belgium and almost immediately after they both arrive in England . He becomes Poirot's lifelong friend and appears in many cases .

Hastings is capable of great bravery and courage , facing death unflinchingly when confronted by ' ' The Big Four ' ' and displaying unwavering loyalty towards Poirot . However , when forced to choose between Poirot and his wife in that novel , he initially chooses to betray Poirot to protect his wife . Later , though , he tells Poirot to draw back and escape the trap . The two are an airtight team until Hastings meets and marries Dulcie Duveen , a beautiful music hall performer half his age , after investigating the ' ' Murder on the Links ' ' . They later emigrate to Argentina , leaving Poirot behind as a very unhappy old man . Poirot and Hastings reunite for the final time in ' ' Curtain : Poirot's Last Case ' ' , having been earlier reunited in ' ' The Big Four ' ' , ' ' Peril at End House ' ' , ' ' The ABC Murders ' ' , ' ' Lord Edgware Dies ' ' and ' ' Dumb Witness ' ' when Hastings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature . Like Christie , she is not overly fond of the detective she is most famous for creatingin Ariadne's case the Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson . We never learn anything about her husband , but we do know that she hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of ' ' Hallowe'en Party ' ' . She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle , and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats . Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer , but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others .

She is an expert on nearly everything and plans to create the perfect filing system . She also worked for the government **34;511493;TOOLONG Parker Pyne . Whether this was during one of Poirots numerous retirements or before she entered his employ is unknown .

A marked difference from the text exists in Moran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , fashionable and emotional woman showing an occasional soft corner for Poirot . # Chief Inspector James Harold Japp # Japp is a Scotland Yard Inspector and appears in many of the stories trying to solve cases that Poirot is working on . Japp is outgoing , loud and sometimes inconsiderate by nature and his relationship with the refined Belgian is one of the stranger aspects of Poirots world . He first met Poirot in Belgium in 1904 , during the Abercrombie Forgery . Later that year they joined forces again to hunt down a criminal known as Baron Altara . They also meet in England where Poirot often helps Japp and lets him take credit in return for special favours . These favours usually entail Poirot being supplied with other interesting cases . In ' ' Agatha Christie's Poirot ' ' , Japp was portrayed by Philip Jackson . In the film , ' ' Thirteen at Dinner ' ' ( 1985 ) , adapted from ' ' Lord Edgware Dies ' ' , the role of Japp was taken by the actor David Suchet , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels # The Poirot books take readers through the whole of his life in England , from the first book ( ' ' The Mysterious Affair at Styles ' ' ) , where he is a refugee staying at Styles , to the last Poirot book ( ' ' Curtain ' ' ) , where he visits Styles before his death . In between , Poirot solves cases outside England as well , including his most famous case , ' ' Murder on the Orient Express ' ' ( 1934 ) . Hercule Poirot became famous with the publication , in 1926 , of ' ' The Murder of Roger Ackroyd ' ' , whose surprising solution proved controversial . The novel is still among the most famous of all detective novels : Edmund Wilson alludes to it in the title of his well-known attack on detective fiction , Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd ?

Called a mini-album by Astralwerks , the collection contains one studio recording ( Pictures ) as well as eight live tracks recorded during an April 2006 concert at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City . Eight songs were written or co-written by Sia ; also featured is a cover version of Ray Davies ' song I Go to Sleep , a studio recording of which later appeared on Sia's studio album ' ' Some People Have Real Problems ' ' ( 2008 ) . The album was produced by Dan Carey , mixed by Jon Lemon and Taz Mattar at Sarm Studios in London and mastered by Emily Lazar and Sarah Register at The Lodge in New York City . ' ' Lady Croissant ' ' received mixed critical reception and failed to chart in any nation . # Composition # Just over forty minutes in length , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The album includes one previously unreleased studio recording called Pictures , co-written by Dan Carey , along with eight live tracks recorded during her 17 April 2006 performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City .

Both songs were co-written by Sia and members of Zero 7 ; Destiny was also co-written by Sophie Barker , another vocal contributor to ' ' Simple Things ' ' . Blow It All Away originally appeared on Sia's 2002 studio album ' ' Healing Is Difficult ' ' , and Don't Bring Me Down , Numb and Breathe Me were each released on her 2004 album ' ' Colour the Small One ' ' .

Allmusic's Marisa Brown called Sia's vocal performance rich and passionate and made comparisons to Nelly Furtado and Morley . Brown stated the band was tight and lush and that the music was very modern , warm and melodic and cleanly intricate . In his review for BBC Music , Paul Sullivan wrote that the album successfully displayed Sia's vocal capabilities and versatility . However , he noted the minimal audience participation and felt that this prevented the album from capturing a live experience . For Sullivan , highlights included Don't Bring Me Down , Destiny and Lentil , which he believed were executed with an appealing mixture of frankness and fluidity . Mark Perlaki of Gigwise.com awarded the album four of five stars and opined that the album portrays an artist who's star is in the ascendant , whose voice is unrivaled in style and expression , an artist on the brink of deserved and assured greater recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection mesmerising and a good indicator of Sia's future work . One reviewer for WERS called the album breathtaking and wrote positively of Sia's vocals and the instrumentation . Like Sullivan , the reviewer warned that listeners expecting a traditional live album with raw cuts and heavy improvisation might be disappointed . Roque Strew of Pitchfork Media found Sia's Adelaide accent to be a liability , specifically noting difference in pronunciation between the studio versions of Destiny and Distractions and the live performances . Strew complimented Pictures and Lentil , the latter of which shined through the fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants . Popmatters ' Mike Schiller felt the instrumentation was robotic and found Sia's vocal manipulation and bending of vowels infuriating , even unintelligible at times . Schiller did , however , favor her vocal tone and found the power of her voice occasionally transcendent . Stuart McCaighy of ' ' This Is Fake DIY ' ' appreciated Pictures but also criticized Sia's performance for lacking diversity and for incomprehensible vocals due to her slurring of words . McCaighy concluded that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was redundant but would be appreciated by fans . The Australian gay publication ' ' DNA ' ' wrote a mixed review for the album in 2010 following the release of ' ' We Are Born ' ' , complimenting Sia's vocals but accusing Pictures of sounding like a B-side. # Track listing # # Pictures ( Dan Carey , Sia Furler ) 3:37 # Don't Bring Me Down ( Furler , Blair Mackichan ) 4:36 # Destiny ( Sophie Barker , Henry Binns , Furler , Sam Hardaker ) 3:55 # Blow It All Away ( Kevin Armstrong , Furler , Felix Howard , Blair Mackichan ) 5:19 # Lentil ( Samuel Dixon , Furler ) 4:11 # Numb ( Furler , Howard , James McMillan ) 4:26 # I Go to Sleep ( Ray Davies ) 3:17 # Breathe Me ( Carey , Furler ) 5:52 # Distractions ( Binns , Furler , Hardaker ) 5:03 Track listing adapted from Allmusic. # Personnel # * Kevin Armstrong composer * Sophie Barker composer * Henry Binns composer * Felix Bloxsom drums * Dan Carey bass , composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Robin Danar assistant engineer * Ray Davies composer * John Dent mastering * Samuel Dixon bass , composer * Tom Elmhirst mixing * Sia Furler composer , vocals * Jos Gonzlez photography * Sam Hardaker composer * Felix Howard composer * Joe Kennedy keyboards * Olliver Kraus cello * Emily Lazar mastering * Joey Lemon mixing * Blair Mackichan composer * Taz Mattar mixing engineer * James McMillan composer * Stephanie Pistel cover photo , photography * Sarah Register mastering * Michael Sendaydiego photography * Gus Seyffert guitar * Jeff Tweedy photography * Joey Waronker drums Credits adapted from Allmusic and CD liner notes . # Release history # \\r\\n@@10058000 Schiano may refer to ; *Greg Schiano - Head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers *Mario Schiano - Italian saxophonist *Rita Schiano - American novelist *Thomas D.

       "\"@@10050000 Producer = Dan Carey ' ' Lady Croissant ' ' is a live album by Australian singer Sia Furler ( better known mononymously as Sia ) , released in April 2007 through the record label Astralwerks . Called a mini-album by Astralwerks , the collection contains one studio recording ( Pictures ) as well as eight live tracks recorded during an April 2006 concert at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City . Eight songs were written or co-written by Sia ; also featured is a cover version of Ray Davies ' song I Go to Sleep , a studio recording of which later appeared on Sia's studio album ' ' Some People Have Real Problems ' ' ( 2008 ) . The album was produced by Dan Carey , mixed by Jon Lemon and Taz Mattar at Sarm Studios in London and mastered by Emily Lazar and Sarah Register at The Lodge in New York City . ' ' Lady Croissant ' ' received mixed critical reception and failed to chart in any nation . # Composition # Just over forty minutes in length , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The album includes one previously unreleased studio recording called Pictures , co-written by Dan Carey , along with eight live tracks recorded during her 17 April 2006 performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City . Destiny and Distractions each appeared on Zero 7's 2001 album ' ' Simple Things ' ' , which featured vocals by Sia . Both songs were co-written by Sia and members of Zero 7 ; Destiny was also co-written by Sophie Barker , another vocal contributor to ' ' Simple Things ' ' . Blow It All Away originally appeared on Sia's 2002 studio album ' ' Healing Is Difficult ' ' , and Don't Bring Me Down , Numb and Breathe Me were each released on her 2004 album ' ' Colour the Small One ' ' . Lentil and the cover version of Ray Davies ' song I Go to Sleep , made popular by both Cher and the Pretenders , would later appear on ' ' Some People Have Real Problems ' ' ( 2008 ) . The album was produced by Carey , mixed by Jon Lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Emily Lazar and Sarah Register at The Lodge in New York City . # Reception # ' ' Lady Croissant ' ' received mixed critical reception . Allmusic's Marisa Brown called Sia's vocal performance rich and passionate and made comparisons to Nelly Furtado and Morley . Brown stated the band was tight and lush and that the music was very modern , warm and melodic and cleanly intricate . In his review for BBC Music , Paul Sullivan wrote that the album successfully displayed Sia's vocal capabilities and versatility . However , he noted the minimal audience participation and felt that this prevented the album from capturing a live experience . For Sullivan , highlights included Don't Bring Me Down , Destiny and Lentil , which he believed were executed with an appealing mixture of frankness and fluidity . Mark Perlaki of Gigwise.com awarded the album four of five stars and opined that the album portrays an artist who's star is in the ascendant , whose voice is unrivaled in style and expression , an artist on the brink of deserved and assured greater recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection mesmerising and a good indicator of Sia's future work . One reviewer for WERS called the album breathtaking and wrote positively of Sia's vocals and the instrumentation . Like Sullivan , the reviewer warned that listeners expecting a traditional live album with raw cuts and heavy improvisation might be disappointed . Roque Strew of Pitchfork Media found Sia's Adelaide accent to be a liability , specifically noting difference in pronunciation between the studio versions of Destiny and Distractions and the live performances . Strew complimented Pictures and Lentil , the latter of which shined through the fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants . Popmatters ' Mike Schiller felt the instrumentation was robotic and found Sia's vocal manipulation and bending of vowels infuriating , even unintelligible at times . Schiller did , however , favor her vocal tone and found the power of her voice occasionally transcendent . Stuart McCaighy of ' ' This Is Fake DIY ' ' appreciated Pictures but also criticized Sia's performance for lacking diversity and for incomprehensible vocals due to her slurring of words . McCaighy concluded that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was redundant but would be appreciated by fans . The Australian gay publication ' ' DNA ' ' wrote a mixed review for the album in 2010 following the release of ' ' We Are Born ' ' , complimenting Sia's vocals but accusing Pictures of sounding like a B-side. # Track listing # # Pictures ( Dan Carey , Sia Furler ) 3:37 # Don't Bring Me Down ( Furler , Blair Mackichan ) 4:36 # Destiny ( Sophie Barker , Henry Binns , Furler , Sam Hardaker ) 3:55 # Blow It All Away ( Kevin Armstrong , Furler , Felix Howard , Blair Mackichan ) 5:19 # Lentil ( Samuel Dixon , Furler ) 4:11 # Numb ( Furler , Howard , James McMillan ) 4:26 # I Go to Sleep ( Ray Davies ) 3:17 # Breathe Me ( Carey , Furler ) 5:52 # Distractions ( Binns , Furler , Hardaker ) 5:03 Track listing adapted from Allmusic. # Personnel # * Kevin Armstrong composer * Sophie Barker composer * Henry Binns composer * Felix Bloxsom drums * Dan Carey bass , composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Robin Danar assistant engineer * Ray Davies composer * John Dent mastering * Samuel Dixon bass , composer * Tom Elmhirst mixing * Sia Furler composer , vocals * Jos Gonzlez photography * Sam Hardaker composer * Felix Howard composer * Joe Kennedy keyboards * Olliver Kraus cello * Emily Lazar mastering * Joey Lemon mixing * Blair Mackichan composer * Taz Mattar mixing engineer * James McMillan composer * Stephanie Pistel cover photo , photography * Sarah Register mastering * Michael Sendaydiego photography * Gus Seyffert guitar * Jeff Tweedy photography * Joey Waronker drums Credits adapted from Allmusic and CD liner notes . # Release history # \\r\\n\""

Explore whether these collocations are idiomatic and so irreducible to the semantic sum of their component words.

Note that no *processing* takes place before parsing sentences--we do not remove so-called stop words or anything that plays a syntactic role in the sentence, although anaphora resolution and related normalization may be performed before or after parsing to enhance the value of information extraction.

    "If we want to compare different corpora, we need a distance or divergence that compares the two distributions.\n",

    "\n",
    "KL and $\\chi^2$ divergences are members of the broader <a \"href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence\" target=\"_blank\">$f$-divergence</a> family, a function of $D_f (P || Q)$ that calculates the difference between two probability distributions P and Q. The KL $f(t)$ is $ t \\text{ log } t $, while the $\\chi^2$ is $t^2-1$. KL comes from information and $\\chi^2$ from measure theory. As such, the KL divergence computes the relative entropy between two distributions--how they differ in bits, while the $\\chi^2$ whether the same statistical inferences can be drawn from them both.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, given two discrete probability distributions $P$ and $Q$, the Kullback-Leibler divergence from $Q$ to $P$ is defined as:\n",

    "$D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q) = \\sum_i P(i) \\, \\log\\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [scipy.stats.entropy()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.entropy.html) function does the calculation for you, which takes in two arrays of probabilities and computes the KL divergence. Note that the KL divergence is in general not commutative, i.e. $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q) \\neq D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\|P)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the KL divernce is the sum of elementwise divergences. Scipy provides [scipy.special.kl_div()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.kl_div.html#scipy-special-kl-div) which calculates elementwise divergences for you.\n",

    "The $\\chi^2$ Divergence is defined as:\n",

    "### Kolmogorov-Smirnov ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-sample Kolmogovorov-Smirnov test statistic calculates the distance between the cumulative distribution function of the two distributions to be compared, and, along with the $x^2$ divergence, is among the most common approaches two calculating a distance in statistics. It can be interpreted as a test of whether two distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution. As with the others, the code is readily available in scipy.\n",

    "### Wasserstein Distance ###\n",
    "\n",
    "When this is computed on a Euclidian metric structure (e.g., numbers of words), this is also known as the earth mover’s distance, because it can be seen as the minimum amount of \"work\" required to transform $P$ into $Q$, where \"work\" is measured as the amount of distribution weight that must be moved, multiplied by the distance it has to be moved.\n",

Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."
